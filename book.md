# Introduction

Compilers, assemblers and similar tools generate all the binary code that
processors execute.  It is no surprise then that these tools play a major role
in security analysis and hardening of relevant binary code.

Often the only practical way to protect all binaries with a particular security
hardening method is to have the compiler do it.  And, with software security
becoming more and more important in recent years, it is no surprise to see an
ever increasing variety of security hardening features and mitigations against
vulnerabilities implemented in compilers.  Indeed, compared to a few decades
ago, today's compiler developer is much more likely to implement security
features than not.

Furthermore, with the ever-expanding range of techniques implemented, it's very
hard to gain a basic understanding of all security features implemented in
typical compilers.

This poses a practical problem: compiler developers must be able to work on
security hardening features, yet it's hard to gain a good, basic understanding
of such compiler features.

There are a lot of materials that explain individual vulnerabilities or attack
vectors. There are also lots of presentations explaining specific exploits.
But there seems to be a limited set of materials that give a structured
overview of all vulnerabilities and exploits against which a code generator
plays a role in protecting.

This book aims to provide such a structured, broad overview.  It does not
necessarily go into full details, instead aiming to give a thorough description
of all relevant high-level aspects of attacks, vulnerabilities, mitigations,
and hardening techniques.  For further details, this book provides pointers to
materials with more details on specific techniques.

The purpose of this book is to serve as a guide to every compiler developer
that needs to learn about software security relevant to compilers.  Even though
the focus is on compiler developers, we expect that this book will also be
useful to people working on other low-level software.


## Why an open source book?

The idea for this book emerged out of a frustration of not finding a good
overview on this topic. Kristof Beyls and Georgia Kouveli, both compiler
engineers working on security features, wished a book like this would exist.
After not finding such a book, they decided to try and write one themselves.
They immediately realized that they do not have all necessary expertise
themselves to complete such a daunting task. So they decided to try and create
this book in an open source style, seeking contributions from many experts.

As you read this, the book remains unfinished. This book may well never be
finished, as new vulnerabilities continue to be discovered regularly. Our hope
is that developing the book as an open source project will allow for it to
continue to evolve and improve. The open source development process of this book
increases the likelihood that it remains relevant as new vulnerabilities and
mitigations emerge.

Kristof and Georgia, the initial authors, are far from experts on all possible
vulnerabilities. So what is the plan to get high quality content to cover all
relevant topics?  It is two-fold.

First, by studying specific topics, they hope to gain enough knowledge to write
up a good summary for this book.

Second, they very much invite and welcome contributions. If you're interested
in potentially contributing content, please go to the home location for the
open source project at <https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook>.

As a reader, you can also contribute to making this book better.  We highly
encourage feedback, both positive and constructive criticisms.  We prefer
feedback to be received through <https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook>.

# Memory vulnerability based attacks

## A bit of background on memory vulnerabilities

Memory access errors describe memory accesses that, although permitted by a
program, were not intended by the programmer. These types of errors are usually
defined [@Hicks2014] by explicitly listing their types, which include:

  * buffer overflow
  * null pointer dereference
  * use after free
  * use of uninitialized memory
  * illegal free

Memory vulnerabilities are an important class of vulnerabilities that arise due
to these types of errors, and they most commonly occur due to programming
mistakes when using languages such as C/C++ \index{C}\index{C++}. These
languages do not provide mechanisms to protect against memory access errors by
default. An attacker can exploit such vulnerabilities to leak sensitive data or
overwrite critical memory locations and gain control of the vulnerable program.

Memory vulnerabilities have a long history. The [Morris
worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm) in 1988 was the first widely
publicized attack exploiting a buffer overflow. Later, in the mid-90s, a few
famous write-ups describing buffer overflows appeared [@AlephOne1996]. [Stack
buffer overflows](#stack-buffer-overflows) were mitigated with [stack
canaries](#stack-buffer-overflows) and [non-executable
stacks](#stack-buffer-overflows). The answer was more ingenious ways to bypass
these mitigations: [code reuse attacks](#code-reuse-attacks), starting with
attacks like [return-into-libc](#code-reuse-attacks) [@Solar1997]. Code reuse
attacks later evolved to [Return-Oriented Programming
(ROP)](#return-oriented-programming) [@Shacham2007] and even more complex
techniques.

To defend against code reuse attacks, the [Address Space Layout Randomization
(ASLR)](#aslr) and [Control-Flow Integrity (CFI)](#cfi) measures were
introduced. This interaction between offensive and defensive security research
has been essential to improving security, and continues to this day. Each newly
deployed mitigation results in attempts, often successful, to bypass it, or in
alternative, more complex exploitation techniques, and even tools to automate
them.

Memory safe [@Hicks2014] languages are designed with prevention of such
vulnerabilities in mind and use techniques such as bounds checking and
automatic memory management. If these languages promise to eliminate
memory vulnerabilities, why are we still discussing this topic?

On the one hand, C and C++ \index{C}\index{C++} remain very popular languages,
particularly in the implementation of low-level software. On the other hand,
programs written in memory safe languages can themselves be vulnerable to
memory errors as a result of bugs in how they are implemented, e.g. a bug in
their compiler. Can we fix the problem by also using memory safe languages for
the compiler and runtime implementation? Even if that were as simple as it
sounds, unfortunately there are types of programming errors that these
languages cannot protect against.  For example, a logical error in the
implementation of a compiler or runtime for a memory safe language can lead to
a memory access error not being detected. We will see examples of such logic
errors in compiler optimizations in a [later
section](#jit-compiler-vulnerabilities).

Given the rich history of memory vulnerabilities and mitigations and the active
developments in this area, compiler developers are likely to encounter some of
these issues over the course of their careers. This chapter aims to serve as an
introduction to this area. We start with a discussion of exploitation
primitives, which can be useful when analyzing threat models [Discuss threat
models elsewhere in book and refer to that section here [161]{.issue}]{.todo}.
We then continue with a more detailed discussion of the various types of
vulnerabilities, along with their mitigations, presented in a rough
chronological order of their appearance, and, therefore, complexity.

## Exploitation primitives

Newcomers to the area of software security may find themselves lost in many
blog posts and other publications describing specific memory
vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. Two very common, yet unfamiliar to a
newcomer, terms that appear in such publications are _read primitive_ and
_write primitive_. In order to understand memory vulnerabilities and be able to
design effective mitigations, it's important to understand what these terms
mean, how these primitives could be obtained by an attacker, and how they can
be used.

An _exploit primitive_\index{exploit primitive} is a mechanism that allows an
attacker to perform a specific operation in the memory space of the
victim program. This is done by providing specially crafted input to the
victim program.

A _write primitive_\index{write primitive} gives the attacker some level of
write access to the victim's memory space.  The value written and the address
written to may be controlled by the attacker to various degrees. The primitive,
for example, may allow:

* writing a fixed value to an attacker-controlled address, or
* writing to an address consisting of a fixed base and an attacker-controlled
  offset limited to a specific range (e.g. a 32-bit offset)[Consider describing
  in more detail why the range limitation matters[162]{.issue}]{.todo}, or
* writing to an attacker-controlled base address with a fixed offset.

Primitives can be further classified according to more detailed properties.
See slide 11 of [@Miller2012] for an example.

The most powerful version of a write primitive is an _arbitrary write_
primitive, where both the address and the value are fully controlled by the
attacker.

A _read primitive_\index{read primitive}, respectively, gives the attacker read
access to the victim's memory space. The address of the memory location
accessed will be controlled by the attacker to some degree, as for the write
primitive. A particularly useful primitive is an _arbitrary read_ primitive, in
which the address is fully controlled by the attacker.

The effects of a write primitive are perhaps easier to understand, as it
has obvious side-effects: a value is written to the victim program's memory.
But how can an attacker observe the result of a read primitive?

This depends on whether the attack is interactive or non-interactive [@Hu2016].

* In an _interactive attack_\index{interactive attack}, the attacker gives
  malicious input to the victim program. The malicious input causes the victim
  program to perform the read the attacker instructed it to, and to output
  the results of that read. This output could be any kind of output, for
  example a network packet that the victim transmits. The attacker can observe
  the result of the read primitive by looking at this output, for example
  parsing this network packet. This process then repeats: the attacker sends
  more malicious input to the victim, observes the output and prepares the next
  input. You can see an example of this type of attack in
  [@Beer2020], which describes a zero-click radio proximity exploit.
* In a _non-interactive (one-shot) attack_\index{non-interactive (one-shot)
  attack}, the attacker provides all malicious input to the victim program at
  once. The malicious input triggers multiple primitives one after the other,
  and the primitives are able to observe the effects of the preceding
  operations through the victim program's state. The input could be, for
  example, in the form of a JavaScript program [@Groß2020], or a PDF file
  pretending to be a GIF [@Beer2021].

::: TODO
The references in this section describe complicated modern exploits.
Consider linking to simpler exploits, as well as some tutorial-level material.
[163]{.issue}
:::

How does an attacker obtain these kinds of primitives in the first place?  The
details vary, and in some cases it takes a combination of many techniques, some
of which are out of scope for this book. But we will be describing a few of
them in this chapter. For example a stack buffer overflow results in a
(restricted) write primitive when the input size exceeds what the program
expected.

As part of an attack, the attacker will want to execute each primitive more
than once, since a single read or write operation will rarely be enough to
achieve their end goal (more on this later). How can primitives be combined
to perform multiple reads/writes?

In the case of an interactive attack, preparing and sending input to the victim
program and parsing the output of the victim program are usually done in an
external program that drives the exploit. The attacker is free to use a
programming language of their choice, as long as they can interact with the
victim program in it. Let's assume, for example, an exploit program in C,
communicating with the victim program over TCP. In this case, the primitives
are abstracted into C functions, which prepare and send packets to the victim,
and parse the victim's responses. Using the primitives is then as simple as
calling these functions. These calls can be easily combined with arbitrary
computations, all written in C, to form the exploit.

For this cycle of repeated input/output interactions to work, the state of the
victim program must not be lost between the different iterations of providing
input and observing output. In other words, the victim process must not be
restarted. 

It's interesting to note that while the read/write primitives consist of
carefully constructed inputs to the victim program, the attacker can view these
inputs as *instructions* to the victim program. The victim program effectively
implements an interpreter unintentionally, and the attacker can send instructions
to this interpreter. This is explored further in [@Dullien2020].

In the case of a non-interactive attack, all computation happens within the
victim program. The duality of input data and code is even more obvious in this
case, as the malicious input to the victim can be viewed as the exploit code.
There are cases for which the input is obviously interpreted as code by the
victim application as well, as in the case of a JavaScript program given as
input to a JavaScript engine. In this case, the read/write primitives would
be written as JavaScript functions, which when called have the unintended
side-effect of accessing arbitrary memory that a JavaScript program is not
supposed to have access to. The primitives can be chained together with
arbitrary computations, also expressed in JavaScript.

There are, however, cases where the correspondence between data and code isn't
as obvious. For example, in [@Beer2021], the malicious input consists of a PDF
file, masquerading as a GIF. Due to an integer overflow bug in the PDF decoder,
the malicious input leads to an unbounded buffer access, therefore to an
arbitrary read/write primitive. In the case of JavaScript engine exploitation,
the attacker would normally be able to use JavaScript operations and perform
arbitrary computations, making exploitation more straightforward. In this case,
there are no scripting capabilities officially supported. The attackers,
however, take advantage of the compression format intricacies to implement a
small computer architecture, in thousands of simple commands to the decoder.
In this way, they effectively _introduce_ scripting capabilities and are able
to express their exploit as a program to this architecture.

So far, we have described read/write primitives. We have also discussed how an
attacker might perform arbitrary computations:

  * in an external program in the case of interactive attacks, or
  * by using scripting capabilities (whether originally supported or
    introduced by the attacker) in non-interactive attacks.

Assuming an attacker has gained these capabilities, how can they use them to
achieve their goals?

The ultimate goal of an attacker may vary: it may be, among other things,
getting access to a system, leaking sensitive information or bringing down a
service. Frequently, a first step towards these wider goals is arbitrary code
execution\index{arbitrary code execution} within the victim process. We have
already mentioned that the attacker will typically have arbitrary computation
capabilities at this point, but arbitrary code execution also involves things
like calling arbitrary library functions and performing system calls.

Some examples of how the attacker may use the obtained primitives:

* Leak information, such as pointers to specific data structures or code,
  or the stack pointer.
* Overwrite the stack contents, e.g. to perform a [ROP attack](#rop).
* Overwrite non-control data, e.g. authorization state. Sometimes this
  step is sufficient to achieve the attacker's goal, bypassing the need for
  arbitrary code execution.

Once arbitrary code execution is achieved, the attacker may need to exploit
additional vulnerabilities in order to escape a process sandbox, escalate
privilege, etc. Such vulnerability chaining is common, but for the
purposes of this chapter we will focus on:

* Preventing memory vulnerabilities in the first place, thus stopping
  the attacker from obtaining powerful read/write primitives.
* Mitigating the effects of read/write primitives, e.g. with mechanisms
  to maintain [Control-Flow Integrity (CFI)](#cfi).

## Stack buffer overflows

A buffer overflow occurs when a read from or write to a [data
buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer) exceeds its boundaries.
This typically results in adjacent data structures being accessed, which has
the potential of leaking or compromising the integrity of this adjacent data.

When the buffer is allocated on the stack, we refer to a stack buffer overflow.
In this section we focus on stack buffer overflows since, in the absence of any
mitigations, they are some of the simplest buffer overflows to exploit.

The [stack frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack) of a function
includes important control information, such as the saved return address and
the saved frame pointer. Overwriting these values unintentionally will
typically result in a crash, but the overflowing values can be carefully chosen
by an attacker to gain control of the program's execution.

Here is a simple example of a program vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow[^oversimplified]:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void copy_and_print(char* src) {
  char dst[16];

  for (int i = 0; i < strlen(src) + 1; ++i)
    dst[i] = src[i];
  printf("%s\n", dst);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  if (argc > 1) {
    copy_and_print(argv[1]);
  }
}
```


[^oversimplified]: This is an oversimplified example for illustrative purposes.
  However, as this is a [wide class of
  vulnerabilities](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html),
  [many real-world examples](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/cweid-121/vulnerabilities.html)
  can be found and studied.

In the code above, since the length of the argument is not checked before
copying it into `dst`, we have a potential for a buffer overflow.

When looking at code generated for AArch64 with GCC 11.2[^build-options],
the stack layout looks like this:

![Stack frame layout for stack buffer overflow example](img/stack-buffer-overflow){ width=80% }

[^build-options]: The code is generated with the `-fno-stack-protector` option,
  to ensure GCC's stack guard feature is disabled. We also used the `-O1`
  optimization level.

The exact details of the stack frame layout, including the ordering of
variables and the exact control information stored, will depend on the specific
compiler version you use and the architecture you compile for.

As can be seen the stack diagram, an overflowing write in function
`copy_and_print` can overwrite the saved frame pointer (FP) and link register
(LR) in `main`'s frame. When `copy_and_print` returns, execution continues in
`main`. When `main` returns, however, execution continues from the address
stored in the saved LR, which has been overwritten. Therefore, when an attacker
can choose the value that overwrites the saved LR, it's possible to control
where the program resumes execution after returning from `main`.

Before non-executable stacks were mainstream, a common way to exploit these
vulnerabilities would be to use the overflow to simultaneously write
shellcode[^shellcode]\index{shellcode} to the stack and overwrite the return
address so that it points to the shellcode. [@AlephOne1996] is a classic
example of this technique.

[^shellcode]: A shellcode is a short instruction sequence that performs an
  action such as starting a shell on the victim machine.

The obvious solution to this issue is to use memory protection features of the
processor in order to mark the stack (along with other data sections) as
non-executable[^trampolines]. However, even when the stack is not executable,
more advanced techniques can be used to exploit an overflow that overwrites the
return address. These take advantage of code that already exists in the
executable or in library code, and will be described in the next section.

[^trampolines]: Note that the use of [nested
  functions](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Nested-Functions.html) in GCC
  requires [trampolines](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Trampolines.html)
  which reside on an executable stack. The use of nested functions, therefore,
  poses a security risk.

Stack canaries are an alternative mitigation for stack buffer overflows. The
general idea is to store a known value, called the stack canary, between the
buffer and the control information (in the example, the saved FP and LR), and
to check this value before leaving the function. Since an overflow that would
overwrite the return address is going to overwrite the canary first, a corruption of
the return address through a stack buffer overflow will be detected.

This technique has a few limitations: first of all, it specifically aims to
protect against stack buffer overflows, and does nothing to protect against
stronger primitives (e.g. arbitrary write primitives). Control-flow integrity
techniques, which are described in the next section, aim to protect the
integrity of stored code pointers against any modification.

Secondly, since a compiler needs to generate additional instructions for
ensuring the canary's integrity, heuristics are usually employed to determine
which functions are considered vulnerable. The additional instructions are then
generated only for the functions that are considered vulnerable.  Since
heuristics aren't always perfect, this poses another potential limitation of
the technique. To address this, compilers can introduce various levels of
heuristics, ranging from applying the mitigations only to a small proportion of
functions, to applying it universally. See, for example, the
`-fstack-protector`, `-fstack-protector-strong` and `-fstack-protector-all`
options offered by both
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html) and
[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangCommandLineReference.html#cmdoption-clang-fstack-protector).

Another limitation is the possibility of leaks of the canary value. The canary
value is often randomized at program start but remains the same during the
program's execution. An attacker who manages to obtain the canary value at
some point might, therefore, be able to reuse the leaked canary value and
corrupt control information while avoiding detection. Choosing a canary value
that includes a null byte (the C-style string terminator) might help in
limiting the damage of overflows coming from string manipulation functions,
even when the value is leaked.

Many buffer overflow vulnerabilities result from the use of unsafe library
functions, such as `gets`, or from the unsafe use of library functions such as
`strcpy`. There is extensive literature on writing secure
C/C++\index{C}\index{C++} code, for example [@Seacord2013] and [@Dowd2006]. A
different approach to limiting the effects of overflows is library function
hardening, which aims to detect buffer overflows and terminate the program
gracefully. This involves the introduction of feature macros like
`_FORTIFY_SOURCE` [@Sharma2014].

Finally, it's important to mention that not all buffer overflows aim to
overwrite a saved return address.  There are many cases where a buffer overflow
can overwrite other data adjacent to the buffer, for example an adjacent
variable that determines whether authorization was successful, or a function
pointer that, when modified, can modify the program's control flow according to
the attacker's wishes.

Some of these vulnerabilities can be mitigated with the measures described in
this section, but often more general measures to ensure memory safety or
[Control-Flow Integrity](#cfi) are necessary. For example, in addition to the
hardening of specific library functions, compilers can also implement automatic
bounds checking for arrays where the array bound can be statically determined
(`-fsanitize=bounds`), as well as various other "sanitizers". We will describe
these measures in following sections.

## Code reuse attacks

In the early days of memory vulnerability exploitation, attackers could simply
place shellcode\index{shellcode} of their choice in executable memory and jump
to it. As non-executable stack and heap became mainstream, attackers started to
reuse code already present in an application's binary and linked libraries
instead. A variety of different techniques to this effect came to light.

The simplest of these techniques is return-to-libc [@Solar1997]. Instead of
returning to shellcode that the attacker has injected, the return address is
modified to return into a library function, such as `system` or `exec`. This
technique is simpler to use when arguments are also passed on the stack and
can therefore be controlled with the same stack buffer overflow that is used
to modify the address.

### Return-oriented programming

Return-to-libc attacks restrict an attacker to whole library functions. While
this can lead to powerful attacks, it has also been demonstrated that it is
possible to achieve arbitrary computation by combining a number of short
instruction sequences ending in indirect control transfer instructions, known
as **gadgets**\index{gadget}. The indirect control transfer instructions make
it easy for an attacker to execute gadgets one after another, by controlling the
memory or register that provides each control transfer instruction's target.

In return-oriented programming (ROP)\index{return-oriented programming (ROP)}
[@Shacham2007], each gadget performs a simple operation, for example setting a
register, then pops a return address from the stack and returns to it. The
attacker constructs a fake call stack (often called a ROP chain\index{ROP
chain}) which ensures a number of gadgets are executed one after another, in
order to perform a more complex operation.

This will hopefully become more clear with an example: a ROP chain for AArch64
Linux that starts a shell, by calling `execve` with `"/bin/sh"` as an argument.
[The prototype of the `execve` library
function](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html), which wraps the
exec system call, is:

```
  int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[],
             char *const envp[]);
```
For AArch64, `pathname` will be passed in the `x0` register, `argv` will be
passed in `x1`, and `envp` in `x2`. For starting a shell, it is sufficient
to:

 * Make `x0` contain a pointer to `"/bin/sh"`.
 * Make `x1` contain a pointer to an array of pointers with two elements:
   * The first element is a pointer to `"/bin/sh"`.
   * The second element is zero (`NULL`).
 * Make `x2` contain zero (`NULL`).

This can be achieved by chaining gadgets to set the registers `x0`, `x1`,
`x2`, and then returning to `execve` in the C library.

Let's assume we have the following gadgets:

  1. A gadget that loads `x0` and `x1` from the stack:
```
  gadget_x0_x1:
    ldp x0, x1, [sp]
    ldp x20, x19, [sp, #64]
    ldp x29, x30, [sp, #32]
    ldr x21, [sp, #48]
    add sp, sp, #0x50
    ret
```

 2. A gadget that sets `x2` to zero, but also clears `x0` as a side-effect:
```
  gadget_x2:
    mov x2, xzr
    mov x0, x2
    ldp x20, x19, [sp, #32]
    ldp x29, x30, [sp]
    ldr x21, [sp, #16]
    add sp, sp, #0x30
    ret
```

::: TODO
Explain how these gadgets could result from C/C++ code. The current
versions are slightly tweaked by hand to have more manageable offsets.
[164]{.issue}
:::

Both gadgets also clobber several uninteresting registers, but since
`gadget_x2` also clears `x0`, it becomes clear that we should use a
ROP chain that:

1. Returns to `gadget_x2`, which sets `x2` to zero.
2. Returns to `gadget_x0_x1`, which sets `x0` and `x1` to the desired values.
3. Returns to `execve`.

Figure @fig:rop-control-flow shows this control flow.

![ROP example control flow](img/rop-control-flow){ width=30% #fig:rop-control-flow }

![ROP example fake call stack](img/rop-call-stack){ width=80% #fig:rop-call-stack }

We can achieve this by constructing the fake call stack shown in figure
@fig:rop-call-stack, where "Original frame" marks the frame in which the
address of `gadget_x2` has replaced a saved return address that will be loaded
and returned to in the future. As an alternative, an attacker could place this
fake call stack somewhere else, for example on the heap, and use a primitive
that changes the stack pointer's value instead. This is known as stack
pivoting\index{stack pivoting}.

Note that this fake call stack contains NULL bytes, even without considering
the exact values of the various return addresses included. An overflow bug that
is based on a C-style string operation would not allow an attacker to replace
the stack contents with this fake call stack in one go, since C-style strings
are null-terminated and copying the fake stack contents would stop once the
first NULL byte is encountered. The ROP chain would therefore need to be
adjusted so that it doesn't contain NULL bytes, for example by initially
replacing the NULL bytes with a different byte and adding some more gadgets to
the ROP chain that write zero to those stack locations.

A question that comes up when looking at the stack diagram is "how do we
know the addresses of these gadgets"? We will talk a bit more about this in
the next section.

ROP gadgets like the ones used here may be easy to identify by visual
inspection of a disassembled binary, but it's common for attackers to use
"gadget scanner"\index{gadget scanner} tools in order to discover large numbers
of gadgets automatically. Such tools can also be useful to a compiler engineer
working on a code reuse attack mitigation, as they can point out code sequences
that should be protected and have been missed.

### Jump-oriented programming

Jump-oriented programming (JOP)\index{jump-oriented programming (JOP)}
[@Bletsch2011] is a variation on ROP, where gadgets can also end in indirect
branch instructions instead of return instructions.  The attacker chains a
number of such gadgets through a dispatcher gadget\index{dispatcher gadget},
which loads pointers one after another from an array of pointers, and branches
to each one in return. The gadgets used must be set up so that they branch or
return back to the dispatcher after they're done. This is demonstrated in
figure @fig:jop.

![JOP example](img/jop){ width=50% #fig:jop }

::: TODO
The gadgets in the figure are made up, chosen to highlight that each
gadget can end in a different type of indirect control flow transfer
instruction. Consider replacing them with more realistic ones.

In figure @fig:jop, `x4` initially points to the "dispatch table", which has
been modified by the attacker to contain the addresses of the three gadgets
they want to execute. The dispatcher gadget loads each address in the dispatch
table one by one and branches to them. The first gadget loads `x0` and `x1`
from the stack, where the attacker has placed the inputs of their choice. It
then loads its return address, also modified by the attacker so that it points
back to the dispatcher gadget, and returns to it. The dispatcher branches to
the next gadget, which adds `x0` and `x1` and leaves the result in `x0`,
branching back to the dispatcher through another value loaded from the stack
into `x2`. The final gadget stores the result of the addition, which remains in
`x0`, to the stack, before branching to `x2`, which still points to the
dispatcher gadget.


### Counterfeit Object-oriented programming

Counterfeit Object-oriented programming (COOP)\index{counterfeit
object-oriented programming (COOP)} [@Schuster2015] is a code reuse technique
that takes advantage of C++ \index{C++} virtual function calls.  A COOP attack
takes advantage of existing virtual functions and
[vtables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table), and creates fake
objects pointing to these existing vtables. The virtual functions used as
gadgets in the attack are called vfgadgets. To chain vfgadgets together, the
attacker uses a "main loop gadget", similar to JOP's dispatcher gadget, which
is itself a virtual function that loops over a container of pointers to C++
objects and invokes a virtual function on these objects. [@Schuster2015]
describes the attack in more detail. It is specifically mentioned here as an
example of an attack that doesn't depend on directly replacing return addresses
and code pointers, like ROP and JOP do. Such language-specific attacks are
important to consider when considering mitigations against code reuse attacks,
which will be the topic of the next section.

### Sigreturn-oriented programming

One last example of a code reuse attack that is worth mentioning here is
sigreturn-oriented programming (SROP)\index{sigreturn-oriented programming
(SROP)} [@Bosman2014]. It is a special case of ROP where the attacker creates a
fake signal handler frame and calls `sigreturn`. `sigreturn` is a system call
on many UNIX-type systems which is normally called upon return from a signal
handler, and restores the state of the process based on the state that has been
saved on the signal handler's stack by the kernel previously, on entry to the
signal handler.  The ability to fake a signal handler frame and call
`sigreturn` gives an attacker a simple way to control the state of the program.

## Mitigations against code reuse attacks

When discussing mitigations against code reuse attacks, it is important to keep
in mind that there are two capabilities the attacker must have for such attacks
to work:

* the ability to overwrite return addresses or function pointers
* knowledge of the target addresses to overwrite them with (e.g. libc function
  entry points).

When code reuse attacks were first described, programs used to contain absolute
code pointers, and needed to be loaded at fixed addresses. The stack base was
predictable, and libraries were loaded in predictable memory locations. This
made code reuse attacks simple, as all of the addresses needed for a successful
exploit were easy to discover.

### ASLR

[Address space layout randomization
(ASLR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization)\index{ASLR}
makes this more difficult by randomizing the positions of the memory areas
containing the executable, the loaded libraries, the stack and the heap. ASLR
requires code to be position-independent. Given enough entropy, the chance that
an attacker would successfully guess one or more addresses in order to mount a
successful attack will be greatly reduced.

Does this mean that code reuse attacks have been made redundant by ASLR?
Unfortunately, this is not the case. There are various ways in which an
attacker can discover the memory layout of the victim program.  This is often
referred to as an "info leak"\index{info leak} [@Serna2012].

Since we can not exclude code reuse attacks solely by making addresses hard to
guess, we need to also consider mitigations that prevent attackers from
overwriting return addresses and other code pointers. Some of the mitigations
described [earlier](#stack-buffer-overflows), like stack canaries and library
function hardening, can help in specific situations, but for the more general
case where an attacker has obtained arbitrary read and write primitives, we
need something more.

### CFI

[Control-flow integrity
(CFI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity)\index{CFI} is a
family of mitigations that aim to preserve the intended control flow of a
program. This is done by restricting the possible targets of indirect branches
and returns.  A scheme that protects indirect jumps and calls is referred to as
forward-edge CFI\index{forward-edge CFI}, whereas a scheme that protects
returns is said to implement backward-edge CFI\index{backward-edge CFI}.
Ideally, a CFI scheme would not allow any control flow transfers that don't
occur in a correct program execution, however different schemes have varying
granularities. They often rely on function type checks or use static analysis
(points-to analysis) to identify potential control flow transfer targets.
[@Burow2017] compares a number of available CFI schemes based on the precision.
For forward-edge CFI schemes, for example, schemes are classified based on
whether or not they perform, among others, flow-sensitive analysis,
context-sensitive analysis and class-hierarchy analysis.

#### Clang CFI

[Clang's CFI](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html) includes a
variety of forward-edge control-flow integrity checks. These include checking
that the target of an indirect function call is an address-taken function of
the correct type and checking that a C++ \index{C++} virtual call happens on an
object of the correct dynamic type.

For example, assume we have a class `A` with a virtual function `foo` and a
class `B` deriving from `A`, and that these classes are not exported to
other compilation modules:

```
class A {
public:
  virtual void foo() {}
};

class B : public A {
public:
  virtual void foo() {}
};

void call_foo(A* a) {
  a->foo();
}
```

When compiling with `-fsanitize=cfi -flto -fvisibility=hidden` [^cfi-flags],
the code for `call_foo` would look something like this:

```
00000000004006b4 <call_foo(A*)>:
  4006b4:       a9bf7bfd        stp     x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!
  4006b8:       910003fd        mov     x29, sp
  4006bc:       f9400008        ldr     x8, [x0]
  4006c0:       90000009        adrp    x9, 400000 <_init-0x558>
  4006c4:       91216129        add     x9, x9, #0x858
  4006c8:       cb090109        sub     x9, x8, x9
  4006cc:       d1004129        sub     x9, x9, #0x10
  4006d0:       93c91529        ror     x9, x9, #5
  4006d4:       f100093f        cmp     x9, #0x2
  4006d8:       540000a2        b.cs    4006ec <call_foo(A*)+0x38>
  4006dc:       f9400108        ldr     x8, [x8]
  4006e0:       d63f0100        blr     x8
  4006e4:       a8c17bfd        ldp     x29, x30, [sp], #16
  4006e8:       d65f03c0        ret
  4006ec:       d4200020        brk     #0x1
```

This code looks complicated, but what it does is check that the virtual table
pointer (vptr) of the argument points to the vtable of `A` or of `B`, which are
stored consecutively and are the only allowed possibilities. The checks
generated for different types of control-flow transfers are similar.

[^cfi-flags]: The LTO and visibility flags are required by Clang's CFI.

Another implementation of forward-edge CFI is Windows [Control Flow
Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard),
which only allows indirect calls to functions that are marked as valid indirect
control flow targets.

#### Clang Shadow Stack

Clang also implements a backward-edge CFI scheme known as [Shadow
Stack](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ShadowCallStack.html)\index{shadow stack}.
In Clang's implementation, a separate stack is used for return addresses, which
means that stack-based buffer overflows cannot be used to overwrite return
addresses. The address of the shadow stack is randomized and kept in a
dedicated register, with care taken so that it is never leaked, which means
that an arbitrary write primitive cannot be used against the shadow stack
unless its location is discovered through some other means.

As an example, when compiling with `-fsanitize=shadow-call-stack -ffixed-x18`
[^shadow-stack-flags], the code generated for the `main` function from the
[earlier stack buffer overflow example](#stack-buffer-overflow) will look
something like:

```
main:
    cmp w0, #2
    b.lt    .LBB1_2
    str x30, [x18], #8
    stp x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!
    mov x29, sp
    ldr x0, [x1, #8]
    bl  copy_and_print
    ldp x29, x30, [sp], #16
    ldr x30, [x18, #-8]!
.LBB1_2:
    mov w0, wzr
    ret
```

You can see that the shadow stack address is kept in `x18`. The return address
is also saved on the "normal" stack for compatibility with unwinders, but
it's not actually used for the function return.

[^shadow-stack-flags]: The `-ffixed-x18` flag results in treating the `x18`
  register as reserved, and is required by `-fsanitize=shadow-call-stack`
  on some platforms.

#### Pointer Authentication

In addition to software implementations, there are a number of hardware-based
CFI implementations. A hardware-based implementation has the potential to offer
improved protection and performance compared to an equivalent software-only CFI
scheme.

One such example is Pointer Authentication\index{Pointer Authentication}
[@Rutland2017], an Armv8.3 feature, supported only in AArch64 state, that can
be used to mitigate code reuse attacks. Pointer Authentication introduces
instructions that generate a pointer _signature_, called a Pointer
Authentication Code (PAC), based on a key and a modifier. It also introduces
matching instructions to authenticate this signature. Incorrect authentication
leads to an unusable pointer, that will cause a fault when used [^fpac]. The
key is not directly accessible by user space software.

[^fpac]: With the FPAC extension, a fault is raised at incorrect authentication.

Pointers are stored as 64-bit values, but they don't need all of these bits to
describe the available address space, so a number of bits in the top of each
pointer are unused.  The unused bits must be all ones or all zeros, so we refer
to them as extension bits\index{pointer extension bits}. Pointer Authentication
Codes are stored in those unused extension bits of a pointer. The exact number
of PAC bits depends on the number of unused pointer bits, which varies based on
the configuration of the virtual address space size.[^tbi]

[^tbi]: If the Top-Byte-Ignore (TBI)\index{Top-Byte-Ignore (TBI)} feature is
  enabled, the top byte of pointers is ignored when performing memory accesses.
  This restricts the number of available PAC bits.

[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangCommandLineReference.html#aarch64) and
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/AArch64-Options.html) both use Pointer
Authentication for return address signing, when compiling with the
`-mbranch-protection=pac-ret` flag. When compiling with Clang using this flag,
the `main` function from the [earlier stack buffer overflow
example](#stack-buffer-overflow) looks like:

```
main:
    cmp w0, #2
    b.lt    .LBB1_2
    paciasp
    stp x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!
    ldr x0, [x1, #8]
    mov x29, sp
    bl  copy_and_print
    ldp x29, x30, [sp], #16
    autiasp
.LBB1_2:
    mov w0, wzr
    ret
```

Notice the `paciasp` and `autiasp` instructions: `paciasp` computes a PAC for
the return address in the link register (`x30`), based on the current value of
the stack pointer (`sp`) and a key. This PAC is inserted in the extension bits
of the pointer. We then store this signed version of the link register on the
stack.  Before returning, we load the signed return address from the stack, we
execute `autiasp`, which verifies the PAC stored in the return address, again
based on the value of the key and the value of the stack pointer (which at this
point will be the same as when we signed the return address). If the PAC is
correct, which will be the case in normal execution, the extension bits of the
address are restored, so that the address can be used in the `ret` instruction.
However, if the stored return address has been overwritten with an address with
an incorrect PAC, the upper bits will be corrupted so that subsequent uses of
the address (such as in the `ret` instruction) will result in a fault.

By making sure we don't store any return addresses without a PAC, we can
significantly reduce the effectiveness of ROP attacks: since the secret key is
not retrievable by an attacker, an attacker cannot calculate the correct PAC
for a given address and modifier, and is restricted to guessing it. The
probability of success when guessing a PAC depends on the exact number of PAC
bits available in a given system configuration. However, authenticated pointers
are vulnerable to pointer substitution attacks\index{pointer substitution
attack}, where a pointer that has been signed with a given modifier is replaced
with a different pointer that has also been signed with the same modifier.

Another backward-edge CFI scheme that uses Pointer Authentication instructions
is PACStack [@Liljestrand2021], which chains together PACs in order to include
the full context (all of the previous return addresses in the call stack) when
signing a return address.
[Add more references to relevant research [166]{.issue}]{.todo}

Pointer Authentication can also be used more widely, for example to implement a
forward-edge CFI scheme, as is done in the arm64e ABI [@McCall2019].
The Pointer Authentication instructions, however, are generic enough to also be
useful in implementing more general memory safety measures, beyond CFI.
[Mention more Pointer Authentication uses in later section, and add link
here [167]{.issue}]{.todo}

#### BTI

[Branch Target Identification
(BTI)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102433/0100/Jump-oriented-programming?lang=en)
\index{BTI}, introduced in Armv8.5, offers coarse-grained forward-edge
protection. With BTI, the locations that are targets of indirect branches have
to be marked with a new instruction, `BTI`. There are four different types of
BTI instructions that permit different types of indirect branches (indirect
jump, indirect call, both, or none). An indirect branch to a non-BTI
instruction or the wrong type of BTI instruction will raise a Branch Target
Exception.

Both Clang and GCC support generating BTI instructions, with the
`-mbranch-protection=bti` flag, or, to enable both BTI and return address
signing with Pointer Authentication, `-mbranch-protection=standard`.

Two aspects of BTI can simplify its deployment: individual pages can be marked
as guarded or unguarded, with BTI checks as described above only applying to
indirect branches targeting guarded pages. In addition to this, the BTI
instruction has been assigned to the hint space, therefore it will be executed
as a no-op in cores that do not support BTI, aiding its adoption.

#### CFI implementation pitfalls

When implementing CFI measures like the ones described here, it is important to
be aware of known weaknesses that affect similar schemes. [@Conti2015]
describes how CFI implementations can suffer when certain registers are spilled
on the stack, where they could be controlled by an attacker. For example, if a
register that contains a function pointer that has just been validated gets
spilled, the check can effectively be bypassed by overwriting the spilled
pointer.

Having discussed various mitigations against code reuse attacks, it's time to
turn our attention to a different type of attacks, which do not try to overwrite
code pointers: attacks against non-control data, which will be the topic of
the next section.

## Non-control data attacks

In the previous sections, we have focused on subverting control flow by
overwriting control data\index{control data}, which are used to change the
value of the program counter, such as return addresses and function pointers.
Since these types of attacks are prominent, many mitigations have been designed
with the goal of maintaining control-flow integrity. Non-control data
attacks\index{non-control data attacks}, also known as data-only
attacks\index{data-only attacks}, can completely bypass these mitigations,
since the data they modify is not the control data that these mitigations
protect.

Non-control data attacks can range from very simple attacks targeting a single
piece of data to very elaborate attacks with very high expressiveness
[@Beer2021]. A very simple example may look something like this:

```
// Returns zero for failure, non-zero for success.
int authenticate() {
  int authenticated = 0;
  char passphrase[10];
  if (fgets(passphrase, 20, stdin)) {     // buffer overflow
    if (!strcmp(passphrase, "secret\n")) {
      authenticated = 1;
    }
  }
  return authenticated;
}
```

The example shows a simplified[^non-control-example] function that reads a
passphrase from a user, compares it with a known value and sets an integer
stack variable to indicate whether "authentication" was successful or not. The
function contains a very obvious buffer overflow, as the string length limit
passed to `fgets` does not match the buffer size.

[^non-control-example]: This is obviously not a realistic example of how
  authentication should be done, but simply serves to illustrate how a
  buffer overflow into a non-control variable can have serious security
  consequences.

Figure @fig:non-control-data-attack shows the stack frame layout for this
function when the code is compiled for AArch64 with Clang 10.0[^ymmv]. As the figure
shows, an overflow of `passphrase` will overwrite `authenticated`, setting it
to a non-zero value, even though the passphrase was incorrect.  The
`authenticate` function will then return a non-zero value, incorrectly
indicating authentication success.

[^ymmv]: The stack frame layout may be significantly different for other
  architectures and compilers.

![Stack frame for `authenticate`](img/non-control-data-attack){ width=60% #fig:non-control-data-attack }

For many more simple examples of data-only attacks that can occur in real
applications, see [@Chen2005]. Although this makes it clear that data-only
attacks are a real issue, it leaves open a very important question: what are
the limits of such attacks? It is tempting to assume that data-only attacks are
somehow inherently limited, however it has been demonstrated in [@Hu2016] that
they can, in fact, be very expressive. [@Hu2016] describes Data-Oriented
Programming (DOP), a general method for building data-only attacks against a
vulnerable program, starting from a known memory error in the program[^caveat].

[^caveat]: The authors describe how DOP gadgets can be chained to simulate
  a Turing machine, making DOP attacks Turing-complete (it's not possible
  to simulate the infinite tape of a Turing machine on any actual hardware,
  of course). Turing-completeness is not, however, a particularly useful
  measure of exploitability, as explained in [@Dullien2018]. Many applications
  offer their users the ability to perform arbitrary computation, for
  example JavaScript engines, and those capabilities can be useful to an
  attacker, but performing a computation without affecting normal program
  behavior does not constitute "exploitation".

The authors of [@Hu2016] describe a small language called
MINDOP, with a virtual instruction set and virtual registers. The virtual
registers of MINDOP correspond to memory locations.  The MINDOP instructions
correspond to operations on these virtual registers, for example loading a
value into a virtual register, storing a value from a virtual register,
arithmetic operations and even conditional and unconditional jumps. The authors
show how to identify gadgets in the code that implement the various MINDOP
instructions and are reachable from memory errors, and how those gadgets can be
stitched together with the help of dispatcher gadgets, the role of which is
specifically to chain gadgets together.

Stitching gadgets together is simpler for interactive attacks, where the
attacker can keep providing malicious input to trigger the initial memory
error and a certain chain of gadgets, as many times as needed. For
non-interactive attacks, the MINDOP jump operations are required as well,
used in conjunction with a memory location that provides a virtual program
counter.

The process of creating a DOP attack is not so simple and not fully
automated. Related literature [@Ispoglou2018] focuses on automating
data-only attacks.

When reading write-ups on recent security issues, instead of terminology
related to data-oriented gadgets, you are more likely to encounter the term
"primitive", which has been described in [an earlier
section](#exploitation-primitives). These concepts are related: an arbitrary
read primitive, for example, can be produced by chaining a (possibly large)
number of DOP gadgets. Talking about primitives offers a nicer level of
abstraction, as it tends to be simpler to reason in terms of higher-level
operations instead of many small pieces of code that need to be stitched
together to perform the operations.

To summarize, data-only attacks are a significant concern. As most of the
mitigation techniques we have seen so far are control-flow oriented, they are
by design inadequate to protect against this different type of attacks.  In the
next section, we will look at what we can do to address them at their source:
memory errors.

## Preventing and detecting memory errors

We have so far discussed how languages that are [not memory
safe](#a-bit-of-background-on-memory-vulnerabilities), like C and C++, are
vulnerable to memory errors and therefore exploitation.  In this section, we
will discuss tools that are available to C/C++ \index{C}\index{C++}programmers
to help them detect vulnerabilities that can lead to memory errors.

### Sanitizers

Sanitizers \index{sanitizers} are tools that detect bugs during program
execution. Sanitizers usually have two components: a compiler instrumentation
part that introduces the new checks, and a runtime library part. They are often
too expensive to run in production mode, as they tend to increase execution
time and memory usage. They are commonly used during testing of an application,
frequently in combination with fuzzers\index{fuzzing}[^fuzzing].

[^fuzzing]: [Fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) \index{fuzzing} is
a powerful testing technique that relies on automatically generating large
amounts of random inputs to the program under test.

A very popular sanitizer is [Address
Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html)
(ASan)\index{AddressSanitizer (ASan)}. It aims to detect various memory errors.
These include out-of-bounds accesses, use-after-free, double-free and invalid
free[^LeakSanitizer]. There are Address Sanitizer implementations for both GCC
\index{GCC} and Clang\index{Clang}, but we will focus on the Clang
implementation here.

[^LeakSanitizer]: ASan also includes a [memory leak
detector](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html)
\index{LeakSanitizer}.

ASan uses shadow memory\index{shadow memory} to keep track of the state of the
application's memory.  Each byte of shadow memory records information on 8
bytes of the application's memory. It represents how many of the 8 bytes are
addressable. When none of the bytes are addressable, it encodes additional
details (whether the 8 bytes are out-of-bounds stack, out-of-bounds heap,
freed memory, and so on).  Requiring one byte of shadow memory for every 8
bytes of application memory means that ASan needs to reserve one-eighth of the
application's virtual address space [@Serebryany2012]. Shadow memory is
allocated in one contiguous chunk, which keeps mapping application memory to
shadow memory simple.

ASan's runtime library replaces memory allocation functions like
`malloc`\index{malloc} and `free`\index{free} with its own specialized
versions. `malloc` introduces redzones\index{redzone} before and after each
allocation, which are marked as unaddressable. `free` marks the entire
allocation as unaddressable and places it in quarantine, so that it doesn't get
reallocated for a while (in a FIFO basis). This allows for detecting
use-after-free. The runtime library also handles management of the shadow
memory.

ASan's code instrumentation in the compiler introduces redzones around each
stack array allocation, and around globals. It then instruments loads and
stores to check whether the accessed memory is addressable, based on the
information stored in the shadow memory, and reports an error if unaddressable
memory is accessed.

ASan doesn't produce false positives and is easy to use. It requires compiling
and linking a program with the `-fsanitize=address` option. It is used in
practice for testing [large
projects](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/asan.md).
There is a similar tool for dynamic memory error detection in the Linux kernel,
[KASAN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.0/dev-tools/kasan.html)\index{KASAN}.

ASan's biggest drawback is its high runtime overhead and memory usage, due to
the quarantine, redzones and shadow memory. [Hardware-assisted AddressSanitizer
(HWASAN)](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.html)
\index{HWASAN} works similarly to ASan, but with partial hardware assistance
can result in lower memory overheads, at the cost of being less portable.

On AArch64\index{AArch64}, HWASAN uses Top-Byte Ignore (TBI)\index{Top-Byte
Ignore (TBI)}. When TBI is enabled, the top byte of a pointer is ignored when
performing a memory access, allowing software to use that top byte to store
metadata, without affecting execution. Each allocation is aligned to 16 bytes
and each 16-byte chunk of memory (called "granule") is randomly assigned an
8-bit tag. The tag is stored in shadow memory and is also placed in the top
byte of the pointer to the object. Memory loads and stores are then
instrumented to check that the tag stored in the pointer matches the tag stored
in memory, and report an error when a mismatch happens.
[Add diagram to demonstrate how HWASAN works [168]{.issue}]{.todo}

For granules shorter than 16 bytes, the value stored in shadow memory is
not the actual tag, but the length of the granule. The actual tag is stored
at the last byte of the granule itself. For tags in shadow memory with values
between 1 and 15, HWASAN checks that the access is within the bounds of the
granule and the pointer tag matches the tag stored at the last byte of the
granule.

HWASAN is also easy to use, and simply requires compiling and linking an
application with the `-fsanitize=hwaddress` flag.

[MemTagSanitizer](https://llvm.org/docs/MemTagSanitizer.html)\index{MemTagSanitizer}
goes one step further and uses the Armv8.5-A [Memory Tagging Extension
(MTE)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102925/0100)\index{Memory
Tagging Extension (MTE)}. With MTE, the tag checking is done automatically by
hardware, and an exception is raised on mismatch. MTE's granule size is 16
bits, whereas tags are 4-bit.
[Consider adding a whole section on MTE and its applications [169]{.issue}]{.todo}


[UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
(UBSan)](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html#ubsan-checks)
\index{UBSan}detects undefined behavior during program execution, for example
array out-of-bounds accesses for statically determined array bounds, null
pointer dereference, signed integer overflow and various kinds of integer
conversions that result in data loss. Although some of these checks are not
directly related to memory errors, these kinds of errors can lead to incorrect
pointer arithmetic, incorrect allocation sizes, and other issues that lead to
memory errors, so it is important to detect them and address them.

UBSan's documentation describes the full list of available checks. The majority
of these checks are enabled with the `-fsanitize=undefined` flag, but
there are also other useful groupings of checks, for example `-fsanitize=integer`
for checks related to integer conversions and arithmetic.

There are many other sanitizers, more than can reasonably be covered in this
section. For the interested reader, we list a few more:

 * [MemorySanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html)\index{MemorySanitizer}:
   detects uninitialized reads.
 * [ThreadSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html)\index{ThreadSanitizer}:
   detects data races.
 * [GWP-ASan](https://llvm.org/docs/GwpAsan.html)\index{GWP-ASan}: detects
   use-after-free and heap buffer overflows, with low overhead that makes it
   suitable for production environments. It performs checks only on a sample of
   allocations.

::: TODO
Describe other mechanisms for detecting memory errors, both

### Bounds checking

Making sure that memory accesses happen within the bounds of each object's
allocation is a very important part of memory safety. This is usually described
with the term "spatial memory safety"\index{spatial memory safety}.
Out-of-bounds accesses result in restricted read/write primitives\index{read
primitive}\index{write primitive}[^restricted]. An attacker can often easily
convert these into arbitrary read/write primitives. For example, this can be
achieved by overwriting pointer fields in allocations following the object that
was the target of the problematic memory access.

[^restricted]: These primitives are restricted since they can only access a
limited number of bytes past the end of the allocation.

The C and C++ memory languages do not, as a general rule, perform bounds
checking[^stdarray]. This is one of the sources of memory errors in C/C++
programs. However, compilers have a history of introducing bounds checks, even
though the language does not require them, in an effort to improve security of
existing C/C++ codebases.

[^stdarray]: Some C++ containers have accessors that do perform bounds
checking, for example `std::array::at()` and `std::vector::at()`.

One of the simplest compiler options is `-Warray-bounds`, which warns when an
array access is always out of bounds. This is therefore restricted to arrays
with statically known size. This option is supported by both GCC and Clang.

Another option supported by both compilers is `-fsanitize=bounds`, included in
[UBSan](#sanitizers), which checks the bounds for accesses to statically sized
arrays at runtime. This handles more cases than `-Warray-bounds`, as it can
also check accesses to dynamic indices. However, it's still limited, as it
cannot perform bounds checks on dynamically sized arrays, and it is still
restricted to array bounds checking. A more comprehensive solution would
also cover pointers in general, especially if pointer arithmetic is
performed.

You may notice that there is a bit of overlap between the bounds checks
introduced by `-fsanitize=bounds` and the Address Sanitizer. Although the scope
of `-fsanitize=bounds` is restricted to statically sized arrays, it's
interesting to note that it can still catch intra-object
overflows\index{intra-object overflow} on array member accesses that the
Address Sanitizer would not, because the access is still technically within the
allocation. For example, given the following code:
```
struct foo {
  int a[6];
  int b;
};

int get(struct foo *x, int i) {
  return x->a[i];
}
```
a call to `get(f, 6)` will give an error with `-fsanitize=bounds`,
but not with `-fsanitize=address`.

Clang and GCC also support two builtin functions that return information on
the size of a variable. `__builtin_object_size` can be used for objects of
statically known size and always evaluates at compile time, whereas
`__builtin_dynamic_object_size` can also propagate dynamic information from
allocation functions that have been marked with the [`alloc_size` function
attribute](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.2/gcc/Function-Attributes.html).
These two builtins can be then used to introduce bounds checks in user or
library code. For example, the [`_FORTIFY_SOURCE`
macro](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/feature_test_macros.7.html)
instructs `glibc` to introduce bounds checks in various string and memory
manipulation functions, such as `memcpy`. The number of checks increases as the
value of the macro increases (the used values are currently 1-3).  For example,
the lower two levels won't use the `__builtin_dynamic_object_size` builtin,
as it has a runtime overhead, additional to that of the checks themselves.

In order to support bounds checking for dynamically sized arrays, a recent
proposal for [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=108896) and
[Clang](https://reviews.llvm.org/D148381) proposes the addition of a struct
member attribute, `element_count`. This attribute will apply to [flexible array
members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_member) in structs,
indicating another member of the struct that expresses the array's length.

The [`-fbounds-safety`](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-enforcing-bounds-safety-in-c-fbounds-safety/70854)
proposal goes a bit further, introducing a similar annotation that can be
applied to pointers more generally. The proposal also aims to reduce the
annotation burden placed on programmers by only requiring the annotations at
[ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)\index{Application
binary interface (ABI)} boundaries[^abi-boundary]. Local variables which do
not cross ABI boundaries are implicitly converted to use wide pointers. These
wide pointers store bounds information alongside the original pointer.

[^abi-boundary]: This refers to the interface between different binary modules,
typically a user program and a system library. The ABI describes low-level
details of that interface, for example the assignment of arguments and return
values into registers or memory. In many systems, the ABI is expected to change
rarely, so programs and libraries can be updated independently and still work
together. This makes ABI changes undesirable, which is why this proposal aims
to minimise them.

There are also hardening efforts focusing on C++ codebases. For example, the
["safe libc++"
mode](https://libcxx.llvm.org/UsingLibcxx.html#enabling-the-safe-libc-mode)
enables a number of assertions that aim to catch undefined behaviour in the
library. The [C++ Buffer Hardening
proposal](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-c-buffer-hardening/65734) aims to
extend this library hardening. The proposal will also introduce a programming
model in which all pointer arithmetic is considered unsafe. Pointer arithmetic
will have to be replaced with alternatives from the C++ library, for example
`std::array`. The implementation of these alternatives in the hardened library
will include bounds checks.

Successfully using bounds checking compiler features for a large codebase
requires substantial effort. An example of this is refactoring the Linux kernel
to use bounds checks for flexible arrays, as described in [@Cook2023].

There are also hardware-based mitigations for violations of spatial memory
safety. For example,
[CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/) introduces
_capabilities_\index{capability} to conventional Instruction Set Architectures.
Capabilities combine a virtual address with metadata that describes its
corresponding bounds and permissions. Capabilities cannot be forged, and can
thus provide very strong guarantees. Arm has developed a prototype architecture
that adapts CHERI, as well as a prototype SoC and development board, as part of
the [Arm Morello Program](https://www.arm.com/architecture/cpu/morello).

Of course, another approach to mitigating spatial memory safety vulnerabilities
is using a language that has been designed with spatial memory safety in mind.
Such languages make sure that all memory accesses are checked, either at
compile-time or runtime. For example, the [Rust programming
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) introduces bounds checks whenever the
compiler cannot prove that an access is within bounds[^rust]. There are many
other memory safe languages, with different characteristics. One example is
JavaScript, a dynamically typed, usually
[JIT-compiled](#jit-compiler-vulnerabilities) language. We'll discuss some of
the issues that arise when implementing support for such a language in the next
section.

[^rust]: Rust also provides features that provide temporal memory safety
and thread safety.

## JIT compiler vulnerabilities

Compiler correctness is obviously very important, as miscompilation creates
buggy programs even when the source code has no bugs. What might be less obvious
is that these bugs can have security implications. For example, they can introduce
memory safety errors in languages that are otherwise memory safe. In some
cases, a bug might leave most programs unaffected and not cause security issues
in practice before it is detected and fixed. This is, of course, assuming that
the bug has not been [intentionally injected in the
compiler](#supply-chain-attacks).

Compiler bugs are an interesting source of security issues for [just-in-time
(JIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation)
compilers\index{JIT compilers}[^jit]. JIT compilation is often used in
programs that receive source code as input during program execution, for
example in web browsers, for executing JavaScript code included in web pages.
In this context, the input to the JIT compiler comes from arbitrary websites
and is therefore untrusted. Bugs in such JIT compilers can lead to compromise
of the whole program (here, the browser) if a malicious input (e.g. coming from
a malicious website) deliberately triggers miscompilation in order to break
memory safety of the language being implemented.

[^jit]: JIT compilers compile code during execution of a program, as opposed to
the more traditional compilation where code is compiled before the program is
executed.

For this section, we focus on JavaScript, which is a dynamically typed,
memory safe language, but the concerns we discuss also apply to other
languages that are compiled dynamically.

Without statically known types, in order to optimize JavaScript code,
JavaScript engines resort to type profiling [@Pizlo2020], recording the types
encountered while executing code. These types are then used during
optimization, which speculates that the same types will be encountered in
future runs of the code, and inserts checks to validate that these
assumptions about types still hold. When a check fails, the optimized code is
replaced by unoptimized code that can handle all types, a process known as
deoptimization\index{deoptimization} or on-stack replacement
(OSR)\index{on-stack replacement (OSR)}. Deoptimization makes sure that the
state of the deoptimized function is recreated correctly for the point of
execution where the type check failed.

For example, a function such as:
```
function foo(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```
will return a number when `x` and `y` are numbers, but a string when either is
a string. An optimizing compiler can use the results of profiling to generate
optimized code. For example, when both arguments are integers during profiling,
it can generate code that looks like this in pseudocode:
```
foo:
  if x not integer, deoptimize
  if y not integer, deoptimize
  result = x + y
  if overflowed, deoptimize
  return result
```

You may be wondering how the type checks are implemented, and this is closely
related to the representation of values in a JavaScript engine [@Wingo2011]. In
short, JavaScript engines use specific bit patterns to indicate whether a value
should be interpreted as a pointer, or as an integer or floating-point value.
For example, the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/) uses the least
significant bit to denote that a [value is a
pointer](https://v8.dev/blog/pointer-compression#value-tagging-in-v8),
otherwise it is a small integer (which needs to be shifted down to access its
value). Pointers then point to objects that contain a [hidden
class](https://v8.dev/docs/hidden-classes) member which is used for type
checking.

In addition to the values for which typing information is gathered during
profiling, optimizing JavaScript compilers propagate the profiled types to
dependent values. For example if a value `x` is expected to be a string, and we
check this assumption, then `x + 1` will also be a string (and no additional
check is needed in this case). In addition to simple type propagation, they
usually perform range analysis\index{range analysis} to determine as precise a
range for a value as possible, which is useful for bounds check
elimination\index{bounds check elimination}.

Bounds check elimination (BCE)\index{bounds check elimination} is a common
optimization in languages that perform bounds checks on array accesses to
ensure every accessed index is within the bounds of the array. BCE gets rid of
bounds checks when they are proven to be redundant, e.g. when the array access
uses a constant index that's known to be smaller than the length of the array.
See
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length)
for details on how out-of-bounds array accesses behave in JavaScript.

Range analysis is a good example of an analysis where a JIT compiler bug can
introduce a vulnerability. Incorrect range analysis results can be used by
bounds check elimination to incorrectly eliminate bounds checks that should
actually have been maintained in the optimized code. For example, for the
following function:
```
function foo(x) {
  y = bar(x);
  var a = [0, 1, 2];
  return a[y];
}
```
If range analysis decides that the value of `y` is in the range `[0, 2]`, but
in reality the value is in the range `[0, 3]`, the bounds check for the access
`a[y]` can be eliminated incorrectly, assuming the access is in-bounds.
[@Glazunov2021] lists a few examples of similar hypothetical vulnerabilities,
along with examples of vulnerabilities of this type that affected widely-used
JavaScript engines.

The type of bug described above provides an attacker with a limited read or
write primitive, as a linear overflow of the array allocation occurs. The
attacker can then build on this primitive to get to an arbitrary read/write
primitive. As JIT compilers generate executable code at runtime, they often use
memory that is writable and executable at the same time. Such memory is very
useful to attackers, who can use an arbitrary write primitive to copy their
payload into this code memory, and then jump to it. Writable and executable
memory, therefore, makes JITs lucrative targets for attackers.

Bugs related to range analysis are just one of the common types of bugs
encountered in a JavaScript engine. [@Groß2022] lists some other common types
of bugs that result in violations of temporal and spatial memory safety, as
well as type safety, in JavaScript engines.

How can we defend against such vulnerabilities? There are several complementary
approaches, for example:

  1. Use fuzzing to discover compiler bugs. For JavaScript, a useful fuzzing tool
     is [Fuzzilli](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/fuzzilli).
  2. Be more conservative when it comes to error-prone compiler optimizations
	 such as bounds check elimination. For example, the
     [V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/) has introduced
     [hardening of bounds checks against typer bugs](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=8806)
     [^bypass].
  3. Instead of trying to prevent compiler (and other) bugs, assume they will be
     present and introduce mitigations that prevent attackers from building arbitrary
     read/write primitives on top of the initial limited primitives that bugs
     provide. For example, for 64-bit architectures, V8 implements a
     [sandbox](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM4fQmIhEqPG8uGp5o9A-mnPB5BOeScZYpkHjo0KKA8/edit),
     built on top of [pointer compression](https://v8.dev/blog/pointer-compression)
     \index{pointer compression}.
     With pointer compression, pointers are represented by 32-bit indices off a base
     pointer instead of as full 64-bit values. By making sure that all pointers
     inside the sandbox (where the JavaScript heap is located) are compressed,
     and that compressed pointers always point inside the sandbox,
     a limited primitive that allows overwriting memory within the sandbox
     cannot be used to build an arbitrary read/write primitive by overwriting
     pointer values.
  4. Preventing code memory from being executable and writable at the same time
     is also desirable. This is known as [W^X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX)
     \index{W\^{}X}.
     A naive implementation of W^X that simply switches memory permissions
     based on page tables temporarily is not enough to prevent attackers from
     writing to code memory [@Song2015], when multiple threads are involved.
     A more effective solution would use a separate compilation process, which
     is the only process that has write access to the JIT's code memory.
     Alternatively, some architectures provide special features that can
     restrict page-based memory permissions from userspace, effectively
     allowing permissions to be different for different threads. Such features
     can also be of use in implementing W^X. For AArch64, this feature is called
     [permission overlays](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102376/0200/Permission-indirection-and-permission-overlay-extensions).

[^bypass]: This naturally leads to attempts to bypass the hardening too
[@Fetiveau2019].

In this section, we have discussed JIT compiler security and described
JavaScript compiler bugs that lead to vulnerabilities. Although we haven't
focused on the details of JavaScript exploitation, an interested reader could
take a look at [@saelo2021a] and [@saelo2021b].

# Covert channels and side-channels

Side-channels and covert channels are communication channels between two
entities in a system, where the entities should not be able to communicate that
way.

A **covert channel**\index{covert channel} is a channel where both entities
intend to communicate. A **side-channel**\index{side-channel} is a channel where
one entity is the victim of an attack using the channel.

The difference between a covert channel and a side-channel is whether both
entities intend to communicate. In a side-channel attack, the entity not
intending to communicate is called the **victim**\index{victim}. The other
entity is sometimes called the **spy**\index{spy}.

As we focus on attacks in this book, we'll mostly use the term side-channels
in the rest of this chapter.

The next few sections describe a variety of side-channels. Each section focusses
on leakage through a specific so-called micro-architectural
aspect\index{micro-architectural}, such as execution time, cache state or branch
predictor state.

## Timing side-channels

An implementation of a cryptographic algorithm can leak information about the
data it processes if its run time is influenced by the value of the processed
data. Attacks making use of this are called timing attacks\index{timing
attacks}.

The main mitigation against such attacks consists of carefully implementing the
algorithm such that the execution time remains independent of the processed
data. This can be done by making sure that both:

a) The control flow, i.e. the trace of instructions executed, does not change
   depending on the processed data. This guarantees that every time the
   algorithm runs, exactly the same sequence of instructions is executed,
   independent of the processed data.

b) The instructions used to implement the algorithm are from the subset of
   instructions for which the execution time is known to not depend on the data
   values it processes.

   For example, in the Arm architecture, the Armv8.4-A
   [DIT extension](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0595/2021-06/AArch64-Registers/DIT--Data-Independent-Timing)
   guarantees that execution time is data-independent for a subset of the
   AArch64 instructions.

   By ensuring that the extension is enabled and only instructions in the subset
   are used, data-independent execution time is guaranteed.


At the moment, we do not know of a compiler implementation that actively helps
to guarantee both (a) and (b).

Using compiler techniques to transform a function such that it respects property
(a) is an active research area. [@Wu2018] provides a method to convert a program
such that it respects property (a), albeit by potentially introducing unsafe
memory accesses. [@Soares2021] improves on that result by not introducing unsafe
memory accesses, albeit by potentially needing to change the interface of the
transformed function.[Also discuss the techniques implemented in the
[Constatine compiler](https://github.com/pietroborrello/constantine)
[172]{.issue}]{.todo}

[2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560689)
[213]{.issue}]{.todo}


A great reference giving practical advice on how to achieve (a), (b) and more
security hardening properties specific for cryptographic kernels is found in
[@Pornin2018].

As discussed in [@Pornin2018], when implementing cryptographic algorithms, you
also need to keep cache side-channel attacks in mind, which are discussed in the
[section on cache side-channel attacks](#cache-side-channel-attacks).


## Cache side-channels

[Caches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing))\index{cache} are used
in almost every computing system. They are small memories that are much faster
than the main memory. They automatically keep the most frequently used data, so
that the average memory access time improves.

When processes share a cache, various techniques exist to establish a covert
communication channel. These let the processes communicate through memory
accesses even when they do not share any memory location. We first describe how
caches work before exploring these techniques.

### Typical CPU cache architecture

There is a wide variety in
[CPU cache micro-architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache) details,
but the main characteristics that are important to set up a covert channel tend
to be similar across most popular implementations.

Caches are small and much faster memories than the main memory that aim to keep
a copy of the data at the most frequently accessed main memory addresses. The
set of addresses that are used most frequently changes quickly over time as a
program executes. Therefore, the addresses that are present in CPU caches also
evolve quickly over time. The content of the cache may change with every
executed read or write instruction.

On every read and write instruction, the cache micro-architecture looks up if
the data for the requested address happens to be present in the cache. If it is,
the CPU can continue executing quickly; if not, dependent operations will have
to wait until the data returns from the slower main memory. A typical access
time is 3 to 5 CPU cycles for the fastest cache on a CPU versus hundreds of
cycles for a main memory access.\index{memory access time} When data is present
in the cache for a read or write, it is said to be a **cache hit**\index{cache
hit}. Otherwise, it's called a **cache miss**\index{cache miss}.

Most systems have multiple levels of cache\index{multi-level cache}, each with a
different trade-off between cache size\index{cache size} and access
time\index{cache access time}. Some typical characteristics might be:

* L1 (level 1) cache, 32KB in size, with an access time of 4 cycles.
* L2 cache, 256KB in size, with an access time of 10 cycles.
* L3 cache, 16MB in size, with an access time of 40 cycles.
* Main memory, gigabytes in size, with an access time of more than 100 cycles.

![Illustration of cache levels in a typical system](img/CacheLevels){ width=40% }

If data is not already present in a cache layer, it is typically stored there
after it has been fetched from a slower cache level or main memory. This is
often a good decision to make as there's a high likelihood the same address will
be accessed by the program soon after. This high likelihood is known as the
[principle of locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference)\index{principle
of locality}\index{locality of reference}.

Data is stored and transferred between cache levels in blocks of aligned memory.
Such a block is called a **cache block**\index{cache block} or **cache
line**\index{cache line}. Typical sizes are 32, 64 or 128 bytes per cache line.

When data that wasn't previously in the cache needs to be stored in the cache,
room has to be made for it by removing, or **evicting**\index{cache eviction},
some other address/data from it. How that choice gets made is decided by the
[cache replacement policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies)\index{cache
replacement policy}. Popular replacement algorithms are Least Recently Used
(LRU)\index{LRU replacement policy}, Random\index{random replacement policy} and
pseudo-LRU\index{pseudo-LRU replacement policy}. As the names suggest, LRU
evicts the cache line that is least recently used; random picks a random cache
line; and pseudo-LRU approximates choosing the least recently used line.

If a cache line can be stored in all locations available in the cache, the cache
is **fully-associative**\index{fully-associative cache}. Most caches are however
not fully-associative, as it's too costly to implement. Instead, most caches are
**set-associative**\index{set-associative cache}. In an N-way set-associative
cache, a specific line can only be stored in one of N cache locations. For
example, if a line can potentially be stored in one of 2 locations, the cache is
said to be 2-way set-associative. If it can be stored in one of 4 locations,
it's called 4-way set-associative, and so on. When an address can only be stored
in one location in the cache, it is said to be
**direct-mapped**\index{direct-mapped cache}, rather than 1-way set-associative.
Typical organizations are direct-mapped, 2-way, 4-way, 8-way, 16-way or 32-way
set-associative.

The set of cache locations that a particular cache line can be stored at is
called a **cache set**\index{cache set}.

#### Indexing in a set-associative cache

For some cache covert channels, it is essential to know exactly how a memory
address maps to a specific cache set.

![Illustration of indexing into a set-associative cache.
In this example:
$L$ = 6 bits, hence the cache line size is $2^6=64$ bytes.
$S$ = 5 bits, so there are $2^5=32$ cache sets.
$N$ can be independent of address bits used to index the cache. If we
assume $N=12$ for a 12-way set-associative cache, the total cache size is
$N*2^L*2^S=12*64*32=24$KB.](img/CacheIndexing){ width=100% #fig:cache-indexing}

Specific bits in the memory address are used for different cache indexing
purposes, as illustrated in figure @fig:cache-indexing. The least-significant
$L$ bits, where $2^L$ is the cache line size, are used to compute an address's
offset within a cache line. The next $S$ bits, where $2^S$ is the number of
cache sets, are used to determine which cache set an address maps to. The
remaining top bits are "tag bits". They are stored alongside a line in the cache
so later operations can detect which specific memory address is replicated in
that cache line.

For direct-mapped and fully-associative caches, the mapping of an address to
cache locations also works as described above. In fully-associative caches the
number of cache sets is 1, so $S$=0.

### Operation of cache side-channels

Cache side-channels typically work by the spy determining whether a memory
access was a cache hit or a cache miss. From that information, the spy may be
able to deduce bits of data that only the victim should have access to.

Let's illustrate this by describing a few well-known cache side-channels:

#### Flush+Reload

In a so-called **Flush+Reload**\index{Flush+Reload} attack[@Yarom2014], the spy
process shares memory with the victim process. The attack works in 3 steps:

  1. The Flush step: The spy flushes a specific address from the cache.
  2. The spy waits for some time to give the victim time to potentially access
     that address, resulting in bringing it back into the cache.
  3. The Reload step: The spy accesses the address and measures the access time.
     A short access time means the address is in the cache; a long access time
     means it's not in the cache. In other words, a short access time means that
     in step 2 the victim accessed the address; a long access time means it did
     not access the address.

::: TODO
Should there be a more elaborate example with code that
demonstrates in more detail how a flush+reload attack works?
[175]{.issue}
:::

Knowing if a victim accessed a specific address can leak sensitive information.
Such as when accessing a specific array element depends on whether a specific
bit is set in secret data. For example, [@Yarom2014] demonstrates that a
Flush+Reload attack can be used to leak GnuPG private keys.

#### Prime+Probe

In a **Prime+Probe** attack\index{Prime+Probe}, there is no need for memory to
be shared between victim and spy. The attack works in 3 steps:

  1. The Prime step: The spy fills one or more cache sets with its data, for
     example, by accessing data that maps to those cache sets.
  2. The spy waits for some time to let the victim potentially access data that
     maps to those same cache sets.
  3. The Probe step: The spy accesses that same data as in the prime step.
     Measuring the time it takes to load the data, it can derive how many cache
     lines the victim evicted from each cache set in step 2, and from that
     derive information about addresses the victim accessed.

[@Osvik2005] first documented this technique in 2005 and demonstrates extracting
AES keys in just a few milliseconds.

#### General schema for cache covert channels

An attentive reader may have noticed that the attacks described above follow a
similar 3-step pattern. [@Weber2021] describes this general pattern and uses it
to automatically discover more side-channels that follow this 3-step pattern.
They describe the general pattern as being:

  1. An instruction sequence that resets the inner CPU state (**reset
     sequence**).\index{reset sequence}
  2. An instruction sequence that triggers a state change (**trigger
     sequence**).\index{trigger sequence}
  3. An instruction sequence that leaks the inner state (**measurement
     sequence**).\index{measurement sequence}

Other cache-based side channel attacks following this general 3-step approach
include: Flush+Flush\index{Flush+Flush}[@Gruss2016a],
Flush+Prefetch\index{Flush+Prefetch}[@Gruss2016],
Evict+Reload\index{Evict+Reload}[@Percival2005],
Evict+Time\index{Evict+Time}[@Osvik2005],
Reload+Refresh\index{Reload+Refresh}[@Briongos2020],
Collide+Probe\index{Collide+Probe}[@Lipp2020], etc.

### Mitigating cache side-channel attacks

As described in [@Su2021], 3 conditions need to be met for a cache-based
side-channel attack to succeed:

 1. There is a mapping between a state change in the cache and sensitive
    information in the victim program.
 2. The spy runs on a CPU that shares a cache level with the CPU the victim runs
    on.
 3. The spy can infer a cache status change caused by the victim through its own
    cache status.

Mitigations against cache side-channel attacks can be categorized according to
which of the 3 conditions above they aim to prevent from happening:

#### Mitigations de-correlating cache state change with sensitive information in the victim program

A typical example of when a cache state change could be correlated to sensitive
information is when a program uses secret information to index into an array. An
attacker could derive bits of the secret information by observing which cache
line was fetched.

Especially in crypto kernels, indexing into an array using a secret value is
generally avoided. An alternative mitigation is to always access all array
indices, independent of the secret value, e.g. as done in
[commit
46fbe375](https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=46fbe375bf) to the PuTTY project, which contains this comment:

>     * iteration, we read _all_ the table entries, and do a sequence
>     * of mp_select operations to leave just the one we wanted in the
>     * variable


#### Mitigations disallowing spy programs to share the cache with the victim program

If the victim and the spy do not share a common channel -- in this case a cache
level -- then a side channel cannot be created.

One way to achieve this is to only allow one program to run at the same time,
and when a context switch does happen, to clear all cache content. Obviously,
this has a huge performance impact, especially in systems with multiple cores
and with large caches. Therefore, a wide variety of mitigations have been
proposed that aim to make attacks somewhat harder without losing too much system
efficiency. [@Mushtaq2020] and [@Su2021] summarize dozens of proposals and
implementations -- too many to try to describe them all here.

One popular such mitigation is disabling [cpu
multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture))\index{multithreading}.
For example,
[Azure suggests that users who run untrusted code should consider disabling cpu multithreading](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/mitigate-se).
[The linux kernel's core scheduling documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/hw-vuln/core-scheduling.rst)
also states mutually untrusted code should not run on the same core
concurrently. It implements a scheduler that
[takes into account which processes are mutually-trusting](https://lwn.net/Articles/861251/)
and only allows those to run simultaneously on the same core.

One could argue that
[site isolation](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/site-isolation/)\index{site
isolation} as implemented in many web browsers is a mitigation that also falls
into this category. Site isolation is described in more detail in
[its own section](#site-isolation).

#### Mitigations disabling the spy program to infer a cache status change in the victim program through its own cache status

In some contexts, the resolution of the smallest time increment measurable by
the spy program can be reduced so much that it becomes much harder to
distinguish between a cache hit and a cache miss. Injecting noise and jitter
into the timer also makes it harder to distinguish between a cache hit and cache
miss. This is one of the mitigations in javascript engines against Spectre
attacks. For more information see this
[v8 blog post](https://v8.dev/blog/spectre) or this
[Firefox documentation of the performance.now() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now)\index{Spectre}.

Note that this is not a perfect mitigation - there are often surprising ways
that an attacker can get a fine-grained enough timer or use statistical methods
to be able to detect the difference between a cache hit or miss. One extreme
example is the NetSpectre\index{NetSpectre} attack [@Schwarz2019] where the
difference between cache hit and cache miss is measured over a network, by
statistically analyzing delays on network packet responses. Furthermore,
[@Schwarz2017] demonstrates how to construct high-resolution timers in various
indirect ways in all browsers that have removed explicit fine-grained timers.

Another possibility is to clear the cache between times when the victim runs and
the spy runs. This is probably going to incur quite a bit of performance
overhead, and may also not always possible e.g. when victim and spy are running
at the same time on 2 CPUs sharing a cache level.

## Branch-predictor based side-channels

### Branch predictors

Most CPUs implement one or more
[instruction pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining).
\index{pipeline}\index{instruction pipeline} In an instruction pipeline, the
next instruction is started before the previous instruction has finished
executing. When the previous instruction is a branch instruction, the next
instruction that needs to be executed is only known when that branch instruction
completes. However, waiting for the branch instruction to finish before starting
the next instruction leads to a big performance
loss.[^branch-prediction-performance] Therefore, most CPUs
predict\index{predict} which instruction needs to be executed after a branch,
before the branch instruction has completed. Correctly and quickly predicting
the instruction after a branch instruction is so important for performance that
most CPUs have multiple
[branch predictors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor)\index{branch
predictor}, such as:

- A predictor of the outcome of a conditional branch\index{conditional branch
  direction predictor}: taken or not taken\index{taken branch}. The prediction
  is typically history-based\index{history-based prediction}, i.e. based on the
  outcome of this and other branches in the recent past.
- A predictor of the target of a taken branch\index{branch target predictor},
  i.e. the address of the next instruction after a taken branch.
- A predictor that is specialized to predict the next instruction after a
  function return instruction.\index{return address predictor}

[^branch-prediction-performance]: Over time, new CPU designs tend to support
having more instructions in flight. [@Eyerman2009, section 4.2.3] suggests that
branch prediction accuracy has to grow more than linearly when the number of
pipelines, or the depth of the pipeline grows. Therefore, there is a constant
push to increase the accuracy of branch predictors.

### Side-channels through branch predictors

A number of attacks have been described over the past few years. The following
sections list a few examples, categorized per branch predictor component they
target.

#### Conditional branch direction predictor side-channel attacks
\index{conditional branch direction predictor}

Two examples are BranchScope [@Evtyushkin2018]\index{BranchScope} and
BlueThunder [@Huo2019]\index{BlueThunder}. These attacks infer whether a branch
is taken or not taken in a victim process. They do so by carefully making sure
that a branch in the spy process uses the same branch predictor entry as the
targeted branch in the victim process. By measuring whether the branch in the
spy process gets predicted correctly, one can derive whether the branch in the
victim process was taken or not.

This can be thought of as somewhat akin to the [Prime+Probe cache-based side
channel attacks](#primeprobe).

When the outcome of a branch depends on a bit in a secret key, this can enable
an attacker to derive the value of the secret key. These papers demonstrate
deriving the secret key from implementations of specific cryptographic kernels.
It can also be used to break [ASLR](#aslr)\index{ASLR}.

#### Branch target predictor side-channel attacks
\index{Branch target predictor}

Two examples are SBPA [@Aciicmez2007]\index{SBPA} and BranchShadow
[@Lee2017]\index{BranchShadow}. These earlier attacks are based on making a
branch in the spy process alias in the BTB\index{BTB} with a targeted branch in
the victim process. They use methods such as timing difference, last branch
records\index{last branch record}, instruction traces\index{instruction trace}
or performance counters\index{performance counter} to measure whether the branch
in the spy process caused a specific state change in the BTB.

#### Return address predictor side-channel attacks
\index{return address predictor}

One example is Hyper-Channel [@Bulygin2008]\index{Hyper-Channel}. In this case,
a spy process invokes $N$ calls to fill up the return stack predictor. Then it
lets the victim process execute. Then, the spy process can measure how many of
its return stack entries have been removed from the RSB, by measuring the number
of $N$ returns that get mis-predicted. If the number of calls in the victim
process is dependent on secret information, this could leak it.

The papers referred to above contain detailed explanations of how they set up
the attack. All of these attacks use a general 3-step approach, similar to
[cache side channels](#general-schema-for-cache-covert-channels):

1. An instruction sequence that resets the branch predictor state (*reset
   sequence*), run by the spy process.\index{reset sequence}
2. An instruction sequence that triggers a branch predictor state change (*trigger
   sequence*), run by the victim process.\index{trigger sequence}
3. An instruction sequence that leaks the branch predictor state (*measurement
   sequence*), run by the spy process\index{measurement sequence}

## Transient execution attacks

### Transient execution

#### Speculative execution

CPUs execute sequences of instructions. There are often dependencies between
instructions in the sequence. That means that the outcome of one instruction
influences the execution of a later instruction.

Apart from the smallest micro-controllers, all CPUs execute multiple
instructions in parallel. Sometimes even multiple hundreds of them at the same
time, all in various stages of execution. Instructions start executing while
potentially hundreds of previous instructions haven't produced their results
yet. How can a CPU achieve this when the output of a previous instruction, which
might not have fully executed yet, and hence whose output may not yet be ready,
may affect the execution of that later instruction? In other words, there may be
a **dependency** between an instruction that has not finished yet and a later
instruction that the CPU also already started executing.

There are various kinds of dependencies. One kind is **control
dependencies**\index{control dependencies}, where whether the later instruction
should be executed at all is dependent on the outcome of the earlier
instruction. Other kinds are **true data dependencies**\index{true data
dependency}, **anti-dependencies**\index{anti dependency} and **output
dependencies**\index{output dependency}. More details about these kinds of
dependencies can be found on
[the wikipedia page about them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dependency).

CPUs overcome parallel execution limitations imposed by dependencies by making
massive numbers of **predictions**\index{prediction}. For example, most CPUs
predict whether conditional branches are taken or not, which is making a
prediction on control dependencies. Another example is a CPU making a prediction
on whether a load accesses the same memory address as a preceding store. If they
do not access the same memory locations, the load can run in parallel with the
store, as there is no data dependency between them. If they do access
overlapping memory locations, there is a dependency and the store should
complete before the load can start executing.

Starting to execute later instructions before all of their dependencies have been
resolved, based on the predictions, is called **speculation**\index{speculation}.

Let's illustrate that with an example. The following C code

``` {.c}
long abs(long a) {
  if (a>=0)
    return a;
  else
    return -a;
  }
```
can be translated to the following AArch64 assembly code:
``` {.asm}
        cmp     x0, #0
        b.ge    Lbb2
Lbb1:
        neg     x0, x0
Lbb2:
        ret
```
The `b.ge` instruction is a conditional branch instruction. It computes whether
the next instruction should be the one immediately after, or the one pointed to
by label `Lbb2`. In case it's the instruction immediately after, the branch is
said to not be taken. Instead, if it's the instruction pointed to be label
`Lbb2`, the branch is said to be taken. When the condition `.ge` (greater or
equal) is true, the branch is taken. That condition is defined or set by the
previous instruction, the `cmp x0, #0` instruction, which compares the value in
register `x0` with 0. Therefore, there is a dependency between the `cmp`
instruction and the `b.ge` instruction. To overcome this dependency, and be able
to execute the `cmp`, `b.ge` and potentially more instructions in parallel, the
CPU predicts the outcome of the branch instruction. In other words, it predicts
whether the branch is taken or not. The CPU will pick up either the `neg` or the
`ret` instruction to start executing next. This is called *speculation*, as the
CPU *speculatively executes* either instruction `neg`, or `ret`.

::: TODO
Show a second example of cpu speculation that is not based on
branch prediction.
[177]{.issue}
:::

Of course, as with all predictions, the CPU gets the prediction wrong from time
to time. In that case, all changes to the system state that affect the correct
execution of the program need to be undone. In the above example, if the branch
should have been taken, but the CPU predicted it to not be taken, the `neg`
instruction is executed incorrectly and changes the value in register `x0`.
After discovering the branch was mis-predicted, the CPU would have to restore
the correct, non-negated, value in register `x0`.

Any instructions that are executed under so-called
**mis-speculation**\index{mis-speculation}, are called **transient
instructions**\index{transient instructions}.^[Transient instructions caused by
incorrect branch-direction prediction have also been called **wrong-path
instructions**\index{wrong-patch instructions} @Mutlu2004]

The paragraph above says "*the system state that affects the correct execution
of the program, needs to be undone*". There is a lot of system state that does
not affect the correct execution of a program. And the changes to such system
state by transient instructions is often not undone.

For example, a transient load instruction can fetch a value into the cache that
was not there before. By bringing that value in the cache, it could have evicted
another value from the cache. Whether a value is present in the cache does not
influence the correct execution of a program; it merely influences its execution
speed. Therefore, the effect of transient execution on the content of the cache
is typically not undone when detecting mis-speculation.

Sometimes, it is said that the **architectural effects**\index{architectural
effects} of transient instructions need to be undone, but the
**micro-architectural effects**\index{micro-architectural effects} do not need
to be undone.

The above explanation describes architectural effects as changes in system state
that need to be undone after detecting mis-speculation. In reality, most systems
will implement techniques that keep all state changes in micro-architectural
buffers until it is clear that all predictions made to execute that instruction
were correct. At that point the micro-architectural state is **committed** to
become architectural state. In that way, mis-predictions naturally do not affect
architectural state. [Could we find a good reference that explains
micro-architectural versus architectural state in more detail? Is "Computer
Architecture: A Quantitative Approach" the best reference available?]{.todo}

**Faulting instructions**\index{faulting instructions} are instructions that
generate an exception at run-time. Many instructions can generate an exception,
and are hence **potentially faulting**. For example most load and store
instructions generate an exception when the accessed address is not mapped.
Since so many instructions can generate an exception, processors typically
speculate that they do not generate an exception to enable more parallel
execution.

When an instruction faults, the execution typically continues at another
location. Any instructions later in the instruction stream which are
speculatively executed before the fault is detected are also called **transient
instructions**\index{transient instructions}.

There is a kind of control dependency between every potentially-faulting
instruction and the next one, as the next instruction to be executed depends on
whether the instruction generates an exception or not. We call out this
dependency separately here as the transient execution attacks we'll describe
next get classified based on whether they make use of transient instructions
after a misprediction, or transient instructions after a faulting instruction.

### Transient Execution Attacks

**Transient execution attacks**\index{transient execution attacks} are a
category of side-channel attacks that use the micro-architectural side-effects
of transient execution as a side channel.

The publication of the Spectre\index{Spectre} [@Kocher2019] and
Meltdown\index{Meltdown} [@Lipp2018] attacks in 2018 started a period in which a
large number of transient attacks were discovered and published. Most of them
were given specific names, such as ZombieLoad, NetSpectre, LVI, Straight-line
Speculation, etc. New variants continue to be published regularly.

Covering each one of them in detail here would make the book overly lengthy, and
may not necessarily help much with gaining a better insight in the common
characteristics of transient attacks. Therefore, we'll try to put them into a
few categories and describe the characteristics of each category.

::: TODO
Decide whether it's useful to talk about alternative categorizations of
transient execution attacks, and if so, do add content. Consider pointing to
[https://github.com/MattPD/cpplinks/blob/master/comparch.micro.channels.md](https://github.com/MattPD/cpplinks/blob/master/comparch.micro.channels.md)
:::

The categorization below is based on one proposed in [@Bulck2020]. There are
alternative categorizations. [@Bulck2020] defines 4 big classes of transient
side-channel attack categories, based on whether:

1. The transient execution happens because of a misprediction, or a faulting
   instruction.
2. The attacker actively steers data or control flow of the transient execution
   or not.

This gives the following 4 categories:

+----------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
|                | Steering of transient execution by attacker?     |
|                +-------------------------+------------------------+

## Physical access side-channel attacks

# Supply chain attacks

A software _supply chain attack_ occurs when an attacker interferes with the
software development or distribution processes with the intention to impact
users of that software.

Supply chain attacks and their possible mitigations are not specific to
compilers. However, compilers are an attractive target for attack because they
are widely deployed to developers, in continuous integration systems and as
JITs. Also, an infected compiler has the possibility to make a much larger
impact if it can silently spread the infection to other software created with
or run using it.

This chapter explores the history of supply chain attacks that involve
compilers and what can be done to prevent them.

## History of supply chain attacks

As far back as 1974 Karger & Schell theorized about an attack on the Multics
operating system via the PL/I compiler [@Karger1974]. In this attack, a trap
door is inserted into the compiler, which then injects malicious code into
generated object code. Furthermore, the trap door could be designed to reinsert
itself into the compiler binary so that future compilers are silently infected
without needing changes to their source code. This attack method was
subsequently popularized by Ken Thompson in his 1984 ACM Turing Award
acceptance speech _Reflections on Trusting Trust_ [@Thompson1984].

If these cases seem far-fetched then consider that there have been several real
examples of supply chain attacks on development tools.

Induc is a family of viruses that infects a pre-compiled library in the Delphi
toolchain with malicious code [@Gostev2009]. When Delphi compiles a project the
malicious library is included into the resulting executable, thus enabling the
virus to spread. The virus was first detected in 2009 and was circulating
undetected for at least a year beforehand. Several popular applications are
known to have been infected, including a chat client and a media player.
Overall, in excess of a hundred thousand infected computers were detected
world-wide by anti-virus solutions.

XcodeGhost is the name given to malware first detected in 2015 that infected
thousands of iOS applications [@Cox2015]. The source of the infection was
tracked down to a trojanized version of Xcode tools. The malware exists
in an extra object file within the Xcode tools and is silently linked into each
application as it is built. File sharing sites were used to spread the
trojanized Xcode tools to unwitting developers.

A trojanized linker was found to be involved in a supply chain attack discovered
in 2017 named ShadowPad [@Greenberg2019]. Some instances of the attack were
perpetrated using a trojanized Visual Studio linker that silently incorporates
a malicious library into applications as they are built. Related attacks named
CCleaner and ShadowHammer used the same approach of a trojanized linker to
infect built applications. Infected applications from these attacks were
distributed to millions of users world-wide.

These cases highlight that attacks on compilers, and especially linkers and
libraries, are a viable route to silently infect many other applications, and
there is no doubt that there will be more such attacks in the future. Let us
now explore what we can do about these.

# Compiler introduced security vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities introduced by compilers have a long history. Thompson
[@Thompson1984] provides one of the oldest and most popular examples in this
area. In his paper, he talks about a compiler that can detect when it is
compiling the login program and can insert a backdoor so that he can use the
system as any user.  However most common cases are where involuntary security
vulnerabilities are added in the generated binary by the compiler.

::: TODO
Explain how code that results in undefined behaviour can often work as the
programmer expected until some optimisation is applied, and perhaps even talk a
bit about why compilers rely on the absence of undefined behaviour in ways that
appear aggressive in some occasions. 
[202]{.issue}
:::

When discussing compiler introduced security vulnerabilities, undefined behavior
plays a major role. Its implications were thoroughly discussed by various works
such as [@wang2012undefined] [@d2015correctness] [@dusilent]. By reading the
works of these authors, one can see that even projects that went through careful
testing, such as Linux, FreeBSD or PostgreSQL, could not escape from this class
of vulnerabilities. To better understand them, this chapter contains several
examples of such vulnerabilities, their implications and how they got fixed.

The first example is a 15 years old vulnerability that affected the random
number generator (RNG) in Mac OS X [@Wang2015]. At some point in the past, this
vulnerability affected all \*BSD operating systems, as they have a common
ancestor with Mac OS.

In the random number generator of the system, more specifically in
`srandomdev(3)`, we can spot the following piece of code used in the seeding
logic:

``` {.c}
struct timeval tv;
unsigned long junk;

gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
srandom((getpid() << 16) ^ tv.tv_sec ^ tv.tv_usec ^ junk);
```

For generating a seed for the RNG, the code uses the current time and an
uninitialized value from the stack, i.e. `junk`. This triggers undefined
behavior as the C standard has no clear semantics for uninitialized loads.
Because of that, there was a huge difference in the generated assembly code for
two different Mac OS X releases.

In Mac OS X 10.6 the generated code looked like this:

``` {.asm}
leaq    0xe0(%rbp),%rdi
xorl    %esi,%esi
callq   0x001422ca      ; symbol stub for: _gettimeofday
callq   0x00142270      ; symbol stub for: _getpid
movq    0xe0(%rbp),%rdx
movl    0xe8(%rbp),%edi
xorl    %edx,%edi
shll    $0x10,%eax
xorl    %eax,%edi
xorl    %ebx,%edi
callq   0x00142d68      ; symbol stub for: _srandom
```

While for Mac OS X 10.7 the code looked like this:

``` {.asm}
leaq    0xd8(%rbp),%rdi
xorl    %esi,%esi
callq   0x000a427e      ; symbol stub for: _gettimeofday
callq   0x000a3882      ; symbol stub for: _getpid
callq   0x000a4752      ; symbol stub for: _srandom
```

In the shorter version of the generated assembly code, the compiler dropped the
whole argument of `srandom` as an optimization. While the optimised code
respects the standard, it leaves room for an attacker to exploit the system
because the seed of the RNG can now be predicted. 

In the meantime, this problem has been resolved in FreeBSD [@FbsdJunk] and
OpenBSD [@ObsdJunk].

Current solutions for detecting this class of vulnerabilities include LLVM's
MemorySanitizer and Valgrind.

The next example covers a new type of undefined behavior that can easily
introduce security vulnerabilities. This time we talk about dereferencing NULL
pointers and what might go wrong with this operation. The following piece of
code is taken from Linux and introduces a vulnerability by dereferencing the
`tun` pointer before it checks that the pointer is valid:

``` {.c}
unsigned int
tun_chr_poll(struct file *file, poll_table * wait)
{
  struct tun_file *tfile = file->private_data;
  struct tun_struct *tun = __tun_get(tfile);
  struct sock *sk = tun->sk;
  if (!tun)
    return POLLERR;
  ...
}
```

Normally, this would cause a crash in the kernel or the function would return
POLLERR if address 0 was mapped in the address space. However the compiler
assumes that `tun` is a valid pointer when the execution reaches the if
statement.  This happens because it saw an earlier dereference just before the
if statement.  In this situation, the check is considered redundant and deleted
from the final binary. This allows an attacker to continue executing code from
`tun_chr_poll` when address 0 is mapped.

To mitigate against this situation, GCC developers added a flag called
`-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` that Linux integrated in its compiler
configuration.

Linux was not the only project that suffered from this problem. Chromium
[@ChromiumIssue] and Mozilla [@MozillaIssue] had problems in the past with this.

There are also cases of security vulnerabilities that are not introduced by
undefined behavior, the following piece of code is such an example. This was
taken from the Linux kernel. Because the compiler sees that the pointer hash is
never used after this point, it decides to delete the memset operation. We call
this dead store optimization (DSO) \index{dead store optimization}. This has
serious security implications because the intention of the programmer was to
delete the `hash` information from memory.

``` {.c}
static void extract_buf(struct entropy_store *r, __u8 *out) {
  ...
  - memset(&hash, 0, sizeof(hash));
  + memzero_explicit(&hash, sizeof(hash));
}
```

The solution Linux came with was to add a new function called `memzero_explicit`
which under the hood looks like this:

``` {.c}
void memzero_explicit(void *s, size_t count)
{
  memset(s, 0, count);
  OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR(s);
}
```

It still uses `memset` \index{memset} to delete the associated security
sensitive data, but it also tries to eliminate the risk of DSO by using the
OPTIMIZER\_HIDE\_VAR macro.  This, however, is not enough to fully eliminate
dead stores [@MemZeroBarrier].  In case of using LTO, the buffer `s` is still
vulnerable. For this reason, Linux maintainers added a further hardening
mechanism by using a compiler barrier instead:

``` {.c}
void memzero_explicit(void *s, size_t count)
{
  memset(s, 0, count);
  - OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR(s);
  + barrier();
}
```

There is still room for improvement regarding the introduced barrier
[@MemZeroDataBarrier]. If the content of the buffer is present in registers,
then the compiler blindly proves again that the DSO can be triggered and the
`memset` will be again deleted. To mitigate against this, the following patch
was proposed:

``` {.c}
+ #define barrier_data(ptr) \
+  __asm__ __volatile__("": :"r"(ptr) :"memory")

void memzero_explicit(void *s, size_t count)
{
  memset(s, 0, count);
  - barrier();
  + barrier_data(s);
}
```

In this patch we create a new barrier that will be guaranted to put the content
of the buffer in memory so that DSO can take no further effect. 

Similar efforts were conducted in other projects such as OpenSSL
[@OpenSSLMemClr]. The approach OpenSSL used is rather different but it achieves
the same end goal, i.e. eliminating the effect of DSO. By making `memset_func` a
volatile pointer to the actual implementation of `memset`, the compiler is
forced to dereference the pointer to get to the actual `memset`, thus
eliminating the risk of optimizing it out.

The C23 committee decided to tackle this problem from another angle, i.e. by
adding a library function called `memset_explicit` [@MemSetProposal]. This
function requires the compiler to not optimize the memory overwrite away.
However it is not trivial to implement such a functionality, as GNU presents in
[@GNUMemSet]. The information may be present somewhere in the machine, even if
it was erased from memory.

## Overview
There are many types of physical attacks – these attack methods focus on one or 
multiple physical properties of systems ( e.g. CPU, GPU, crypto hardware), and 
can either be 

-	Passive – just monitoring physical quantities (e.g. side channel information
	leakage), or
-	Active – modification of physical quantities, for example, by
    -	changing the operation conditions of the system so that the circuit
      operates outside its specifications (e.g. by changing temperature, or by
      applying glitches to supply voltage/clock source)
    -	injecting faults to the system (e.g. altering the electrical state of the
      system using Electromagnetic pulse injection, or laser beam)
    -	physically modifying the system/chip

In the rest of this section, we will focus on a subset of physical attacks:

-	Side channel information leakage
-	Physical attack using glitches

These two forms of attacks can be carried out using low cost hardware, and have 
been widely demonstrated by researchers on SoCs or microcontrollers developed for 
IoT (Internet-of-Things) applications.

## Physical access side-channel attacks  
If an attacker has physical access to a device, even without debug access, the 
attacker can collect side channel information about the program execution on a 
processor. If the processor is used to handle cryptographic operations, the side 
channel information can be used to deduce the crypto key(s) or the data being 
processed. Please note that some forms of physical attacks (e.g. fault injection 
attacks like rowhammer and voltjockey) do not require physical access, but 
those attacks are not covered in this section.

### How is information leaked?
The most common physical access side channel attack method is to capture the 
voltage or current consumption of the device during its operation. Every time 
a flip-flop toggles, the switching activity results in a small current spike. 
Even though there is capacitance on the power distribution connections inside 
the chip, the toggling of registers (composed of flip-flops) still results in 
variations in the power supply current, which can be observed easily.
Because the connections for delivering power (at the power supply, printed 
circuit board, on chip packages as well as on the silicon dies) also contain 
resistance, the variation of electrical current in the chip’s power supply also 
results in variations in the power supply voltage. Again, this can be observed 
easily if the attacker has physical access to the device.
If an attacker has access to data acquisition equipment that can record the 
current/voltage/power patterns, he/she can record the “power signature” 
for different crypto operations, including the power signature using different 
data inputs. By applying analysis techniques like differential power analysis, 
the attacker can extract the information being processed.
One additional form of side-channel leakage is electro-magnetic radiation. 
Because the processor’s clock frequency is usually in the radio frequency (RF) 
range, the wires on the die and the tracks on the PCB become small antennas, 
and the ripples in the processor’s voltage/current results in radio frequency 
signals. Although the RF power radiated can be tiny, it still means that an 
attacker can observe the side-channel leakage if he/she is in close proximity 
from the device and has the right equipment to amplify and record the RF power 
signature. However, the risk of such attack can be reduced by reducing the 
radiation energy level using:

- Shielding around the device, including ground plate on the circuit board.
- Coupling capacitors on power supply tracks on the printed circuit board.

Generally, such an attack requires knowledge of radio circuit techniques and the 
result can be affected by other factors. For example, in normal environments 
there are many other source of RF noises that affects the accuracy of signal 
measurement. In a “noisy” environment, the RF signals from various wireless 
communication gadgets nearby might drown out the signals from the device being 
monitored.

### Side channel leakage at instruction level
Instruction executions can result in various forms of side channel leakage:

Cycle timing resulting from conditional branch – A code sequence containing a 
conditional branch could result in observable side channel leakage. For example, 
if the power signatures of several code segments are easily recognizable 
(process A, B and C in the following diagram), it is possible to detect if the 
conditional branch was taken or not.


![leakage of conditional branch](img/side_channel_leakage_figure_1_branch){ width=80% }

Cycle timing resulting from specific data values – The execution cycles of some 
instructions can be dependent on the values of input data, resulting in timing 
side-channel leakage. E.g., the integer divide instruction in Arm Cortex-M 
processors.

![leakage of execution cycle](img/side_channel_leakage_figure_2_duration){ width=80% }

Power variation due to value changes – The power spikes in the power signature 
are often dependent on a combination of how many bits are set and how many bits 
have toggled in the register(s) --- the so-called Hamming weight and Hamming 
distance, so the amplitude of the spike could be used to guess the register value 
in that clock cycle. The power spikes can be caused by a combination of

- Logic switching due to the operations of an instruction (e.g. power consumed
  by a single cycle multiplier can be much higher than the power used by a
  Boolean logic function), and
- Logic switching due to changes in data values in the register bank and data
  paths.

The switching activities are dependent on preceding and next operations. If the 
power signature of the codes around a specific instruction is recognizable, then 
the data value being process could be guessed.

![leakage of number of bit toggled](img/side_channel_leakage_figure_3_toggle){ width=80% }

In some SoC or microcontroller implementations, the power spike effect of the 
operations can be much higher than the effect of data value changes in the 
register banks.  In such case the program execution flow can be observed, and 
as a result, might also indirectly leak information about the data that it is 
processing.

### Countermeasures
For normal embedded devices that don’t have physical protection features, there 
is a much higher chance that power/voltage/radiation side channels can result 
in information leakage. However, some aspects of timing signature leakage could 
be reduced:

- Using data processing instruction with data independent timing for
  cryptographic operations. In recent Arm architectures (including Armv8-A and
  Armv8-M), some instructions are architecturally defined as DIT (Data
  Independent Timing).
- For conditional branches where the condition is dependent on secret data, use
  table branch instead might help reduce timing base leakage (both paths result
  in a branch). It is not necessary to replace all conditional branch. For
  example, many loop counters in crypto operation can be independent to the
  crypto key or input data values, so there is no need to change those loops.

There is overlap with section timing-side-channels. How to best consolidate that?

There are additional software techniques to mitigate power leakage. One of the 
most well-known techniques is masking (e.g. Boolean, multiplicative, affine). 
When applying software mitigation, software developers need to check that 
optimizations carried out by compilers (C/C++) do not impact the mitigation, 
as compilers can be very smart and undo the masking in order to perform 
faster operations (or reducing code size).

## Fault injection attacks
### Common forms of Fault injection attacks
If an attacker has physical access to a device, they can also choose to use 
physical attacks to modify the behavior of the software, for example, prevent 
the software from setting up certain security features during the device’s 
initialization sequence. The two most common forms of such attacks are voltage 
glitching and clock glitching.

![common fault injection attacks](img/physical_attacks){ width=80% }


* Voltage glitch attack
    * Using a programmable power supply that can switch the voltage level
      rapidly, it is possible to reduce/increase the power supply voltage of a
      chip at specific clock cycle of the software execution. In some case, a
      precise voltage drop can cause a processor to “skip” an instruction, for
      example, the write to memory or a hardware register might not be taken.
      Or if a write has taken place, the actual write value used could be
      changed by the voltage glitch.
* Clock glitch attack
    * Using a clock switching circuit, it is possible to reduce the width of a
      clock pulse, or the interval between two clock pulses so that some of the
      hardware registers are not updated correctly at certain clock edge(s).
      Similar to voltage glitch, this can make the hardware seems to be
      skipping an instruction.


Such voltage/clock glitch attack could affect multiple parts in the processors, 
but sometimes the impact might not lead to any visible error in the operation, 
leaving the only effect that the processor skipping a memory/register write, or 
writing an incorrect value. Potentially, a glitch attack could result in other 
observable effect (e.g. register reset, bit toggle). The analysis of fault 
injection methods (and their physical effect) and the observable effects at 
the program or instruction execution level are often referred to as fault 
models, where one can say that a specific fault injection behaves as an 
instruction skip, etc. More details about the concept of fault models can be 
found in the paper "Fault Attacks on Secure Embedded Software: Threats, Design 
and Evaluation” (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10513.pdf), where a good 
illustration of the concept is shown in figure 1 of that paper.

Using glitching methods, there are several common ways of attacking a system. 
For example:

*	Skipping an instruction during setup sequence for security features – e.g.
  skipping the write to the MPU (Memory Protection Unit)/Security Attribution
  Unit (SAU) so that the MPU/SAU is not enabled.
*	Skipping an instruction after a security authentication that branch to an
  error handling code. As the branch is not taken, the code can continue to
  operate even a security authentication has failed.
*	Causing an incorrect value to be written in a memory or hardware. E.g. When
  writing a crypto key to a crypto accelerator, forcing the key value written
  to be zero (caused to low voltage on bus hardware).

Example: Attack on TrustZone for Armv8-M: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u6BAH8mEDw 

There are other forms of physical attacks, but most of them requires 
significant effort or cost (e.g. cut open the chip package can carry out 
fault injection or readout secret data on chip).

### Countermeasures
Ideally, system designers can use hardware (SoCs or microcontroller) that 
support protection against fault injection. For example, a hardware circuit 
can include redundancy logic (spatial and temporal). In addition, software 
developers can make such attack harder by adding checks after the write 
operations.
When applying software mitigation, software developers need to check that 
optimizations carried out by compilers (C/C++) do not impact the mitigation.
